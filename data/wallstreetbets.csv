They've only had 1 quarter of positive cash in their entire existence (back in 2011). [https://ycharts.com/companies/APHA/free\_cash\_flow](https://ycharts.com/companies/APHA/free_cash_flow)

  
They grow 45000kg/q and sell a fraction of that and continue to use their unsold inventory (currently at 320M) to fluff their numbers every quarter.  You should expect a massive write down in the next couple of quarters

Their 350M in cash are ALL loans or convertible debenture so you can also expect more dilution in their future

Management likes to be aggressive with the valuation of their unsold tangible assets to the extent their auditors (PWC) called them out on it in their q4 fins.  Read page 3 : [https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aphria-Q4-2020-consolidated-financial-statements-w-Auditors-Report-7.29-0015.pdf](https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aphria-Q4-2020-consolidated-financial-statements-w-Auditors-Report-7.29-0015.pdf)

Their all in cost at C1.50 is really not that good

On top of which, Irwin got 18M this year (almost as much as what sweetwater is suppose to accrete to them)

Scalping is fine but keep a more critical eye if you are investing in them for the long term."

[StockDip] Salesforce Buying Slack? Yesplz!,1606784684,Wetter42,12,"Salesforce is buying slack.  Great news.  My company uses BOTH of those applications and they're both very promising, but what does that mean for the stock?  

Typically when company A buys company B, the company A's stock goes down while company B goes up.  Why?  This is because Company A is spending (typically) a LOT of money to acquire company B and Company B is good enough to get acquired.  

I don't forsee any type of Salesforce Slander hitting the news, and companys generally recover long-term after buying a company once it's discovered that the acquired company was a good investment.  

What does that mean for you?  Well if you're smart, that means research, but otherwise, that also means long term calls on Salesforce (if you can afford cause it's pricey af).

My first day at college and learning stocks.,1606784861,afi44,23,"Hey guys

I just wanted a share a story with you all, not sure if this kind of shit is allowed here, but I wanted to break up some of the PLTR threads and having some refreshing humor at my expense.  This is pretty funny, and a true story.  And ties in some stocks at the end.

So let me begin, I'm a heavy set M A N.  I am in my 30s, and went to college in my late 20s because I wanted to stop flipping burgers at Burger King and make something of myself.

So while I worked at Burger King at night, I went to school during the day.

So this is the story of my first day at college as a 28 something man.

As I was walking up the steps to the front door to get class, it is 2 sets of stairs and I am already sweatin'.  I see this 18 year old girl in front of me and I try to get into the same revolving door as her except I didn't realize it was meant for 1 person.  So as I get in there (heavy breathing) I am literally on top of this small girl on accident.  She lets out a verbal ""ugh"". And I start to backout as she is going forward and realize i'm too late and am committed at this point. (oh fuck) in order to refrain from grinding on her, I humped to the left and right trying to dodge her but she ended up slipping and her arm brushed against my sweaty arms and she got slimed.  This is a pic of the door for reference.  She screamed.

https://preview.redd.it/mi1357p73h261.png?width=1416&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07da41e22c32e3d1f322bf59fef5d378775388af

So she darted out disgusted at me, and saw I was going for the elevator (likely to avoid me she took the stairs).

I get to the third floor and lo and behold she's there getting out of the stairwell and I say ""good morning"" not realizing it's the same girl because I never looked at her in the eyes and gives me a dirty look.

So she goes into room 301 and I am looking for room 303.  However door 303 is locked, I ask a janitor what is going on I have class in 5 mins and he shrugs and says No Hablo Espanol and descends into the halls.  I saw a couple of 18/19 year olds naruto running into 301 and asked them what is going on with room 303? and they said, 303 has been moved to 301. 

It was PACKED and you guys won't believe it but, there was only 2 seats available, 1 table with the girl who sat in the center.  So either freaking way I would have to sit next to this girl I slimed.  

Honestly class was pretty unremarkable nothing too funny happened, sat there quietly.

However, after class... I am walking towards the elevator and she is probably 10 ft behind me and I hold the door for her.  She says to me, honest to god ""No."" 

""I'll take the next one.""

Went home defeated that day boys.  But after that, I had a finance class where I learned about trading stocks and we all made paper trade accounts.  Most of the little kiddies bought Google and Apple, I put every dime into AMD and got 1st place.  Good times."

They have two US based cannabis assets with $2M+ projected annualized revenue in SAC Pharma and Noble Line, both with great growth and margins, when investors start searching for US companies theyâ€™ll find how undervalued these two are! They also have 30M shares in Gaia(worth $450K today but real value is higher), 51% in NuWave with potential contracts with food chains, TripPharam clinic opening next and psychedelics initiative, Spaced Food tech, kits potential sales in USA and possibility of HC approval any time. Itâ€™s a $4M MCap with less than 16M shares as of today.

SAC Pharma, a wholly owned subsidiary of Blackhawk Growth BLR, is a California based cash-flow positive cannabis producer. Presentation https://www.blackhawkgrowth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/SacPharma_CorporatePresentation_July2020_Rev003.pdf

"Meme stocks = Waves, the next one?",1606786551,Cold-Cash-1842,59,"These ultra fast, ultra high gain stocks come at ya like waves in the ocean.. they start small, in fact many start small and never amount to anything. But the ones that do build up speed, momentum and velocity do so at a ferocious speed. Some of them are giants and just like 60ft waves in the the Atlantic Ocean they crash just as intensely as they began.  PLTR is done. You have to admit that to yourself. It went from $10 to $30 in a month, why? Because of fundamentals?! Is that why you bought in? It wasnâ€™t why I did.  I got in at $11 (and out at $28) because of mostly luck and also because the IPO seemed like a non starter.  Or like it wanted to go but it didnâ€™t have the popularity? Idk... it doesnâ€™t matter.. what matters is the hundreds of thousands of orders at $15 caused the orders at $18 and those caused $23 etc... its a wave.  Itâ€™s driven by price and FOMO. NOTHING ELSE. 9.9 out of 10 people who own PLTR stock donâ€™t know how to say the name of the company. 
So apart from being on some high horse, what am I getting at?  Look for the waves that are beginning to brew. Ok so fundamentals are complicated and reading charts is for David Blaine but what about the meme stocks that might be next to pop? You could make a lifetime of money if you could learn to sense the wave, like once itâ€™s 10-15% started and learn to exit around the 80-90% of the waves peak.  Even if you just rode waves from 40%-70% of their total move... youâ€™d make good money.  How? Well thatâ€™s mostly up to us to figure out.  As millennials we pride ourselves on being masters of social media, communication and instant information... so we should be able to get a sense for whatâ€™s likely to be the next mover. It literally doesnâ€™t matter the ticker or what they make or what theyâ€™re worth. All that matters is that a bunch more people think they wonâ€™t be the last to click buy. Thatâ€™s all there is to it. 

Considering there are 1 million members here, youâ€™d think more people would be dropping more new tickers that weâ€™ve never heard of. Making more of a case for the weird and wonderful.

Donâ€™t be that dude splashing around in the ocean hoping the wave will start again. That shit is over.

[DD] GME earnings and option positioning,1606786753,KYJELLYTIME69,42,"Ok retards it's time to take a closer look at GME now that earnings are coming up on Dec 8th. First of all don't expect earnings beat from GME for this quarter, shortage of consoles and competition from Amazon and Walmart means GME's probably gonna post a disappointing report, they'll probably guide up and highlight their cleaner balance sheet and maybe even talk about restructuring like Ryan Cohen wanted but who knows what gonna happen. So yea it might dump after earnings. 

but we ain't here to ""invest"" fundamentally, we're here for the epic short squeeze.  I don't give a shit about their FCF or valuation based on whatever fuckhead analyst's model. Whatever happens after earnings, it's important that we diamond hand this baby and roll your calls instead of just selling it like a weak ass pussy. 

IV for options around earnings are huge at \~250%, so there's a good chance that a lot of you retards will get IV crushed (if you're worried buy your calls further out, closer to the money or just buy shares) 

What I noticed is that there's a huge open interest of 20k for Dec 18 $17 puts and 12k for Dec 18 $16.5 puts. OI for call options doesn't even compare. Lots of gay bears (or maybe it's a hedge idk)  gonna get IV crushed, which is actually more bullish than you think. Because when those puts expire worthless, MM is gonna close their hedges by BUYING BACK the stock that they shorted when they hedged those puts. This effect MIGHT be very noticeable EOD on Dec 18 2020. In fact, it's probably what happened to PLTR last Friday, when about 30% of all calls expired and MM sold their hedges as your calls expired worthless, leading to a dump.

Do what you will with this information, but MINIMUM pain for MM at that week dec 18 is situated right around the $17 mark, unless the MM gamma exposure changes.

"Believe it or not, you retards know what you're doing (Sort of)",1606789344,Reuslan,42,"Hey investors. I'm a 17-year-old senior in high school who used to watch videos on dropshipping and making money as a teenager practically 24/7. Stocks have become one of the most interesting things I've ever laid my eyes on and at about 15ish, and  I started to look into them right away. I watched countless random youtube videos trying to explain the stock market, and me being the clueless teen I am I had absolutely no idea wtf these random lines and charts meant and how they work.

Still haven't officially touched the market yet, but definitely going to soon. I've always been too afraid to lose my 1000 or so dollars I have saved up due to a bad market play. Luckily for me, my school has an Investing club. It's a group of 30 kids who are put into 5 groups and we are all doing a Stock Simulator on investopedia.com. Everyone starts with a million dollars and you make your plays whenever you want. The groups meet once a week and ""discuss"" what stocks to play and stuff like that. No discussion is really done because we're all awkward lazy teenagers who just care about weed and PS4 and so on. 

Then I discovered you idiots.

Since the beginning of September, I've been looking through and asking questions in the Daily Thread section. You guys obviously would always have mixed opinions on certain stocks, but I would pretty much just continue scrolling through the thread until I was convinced to do a play. I've also been constantly looking at the Hot DDs that are usually right below the Daily Discussion thread, and when I'm bored I sometimes go onto a completely different website to check out a different type of Hot DDs.

Just wanted to say that I am currently in first place out of the 30 students in my class, and its not even close. I've attached pictures of the rankings as well as my trade history. You'll see that my trade history is literally just stonks that are constantly talked about in the Discussion Thread and in DDs. 

Basically, if I see (Ticker)  ðŸš€  ðŸš€  ðŸš€ multiple times in the thread, I'd buy into it.

Will I end up losing and getting last place? Possibly. But it'll only happen based on you guys - because I've practically only listened to you guys for the past few months. 

So moral of the story - You guys are not as dumb as you think. r/wallstreetbets is superior to r/investing and the other boomer Reddits, but you already knew that.

10 garden tips for WSB Newbies,1606789745,reetourebel,12,"Reading through some of the posts I can see how a lot of newbies have FOMO (fear of missing out). Post after post of losers making huge returns. Everyone is getting rich but you. Boofuckinghoo. The smart gardener realizes itâ€™s all hype. Some of it works, most of it doesnâ€™t. To be successful you need to be able to recognize the difference and to do that, you need time, knowledge and practice.

Here are ten tips that can help you along the way.

**Tip 1 - You donâ€™t know shit**

Youâ€™re going to lose your veggies if you don't use good fertilizer: organic chicken shit. Donâ€™t get suckered by reading posts about guys who made 1000% return in 5 minutes using their own feces as fertilizer. For every one guy that posts his massive shit gains, 100+ suckers have lost their bowels due to crippling diarrhea. The first lesson to realize is that itâ€™s way easier to lose veggies in the garden than to make veggies. 

**Tip 2 - Understand how water flows in the garden**

Water moves from the topsoil to the bottomsoil, from the roots to the plant. Any dummy can water short term. But to make water long-term and truly grow a garden, you have to be armed with knowledge and a shit ton of irrigation equipment.

**Tip 3 - Play for the long term**

The most important rule you need to follow religiously is NEVER FUCKING LOSE VEGGIES. Grow it big, water it to the roots. Your top responsibility is protecting your plant. YOLO is a stupid play. 99% of you are going to plant at the wrong time with the wrong seeds. Calm the fuck down and work on a long term strategy. You have decades dummy.

**Tip 4 - Time is on your side, but not much else**

The garden never stops. The garden just churns and churns. Summer to winter, winter to summer, it just keeps on turning and turning. There are ALWAYS opportunities. Another tomato plant. Another mint plant. FOMO is for fools. Miss a planting season? Big fucking deal. Thereâ€™s another one around the corner. You have plenty of time to learn, test, and grow your veggies.

**Tip 5 - Harvest Moon for N64**

Harvest Moon is a simulation. It behaves exactly like a real garden with real active plants but itâ€™s all practice. No real veggies grow. Itâ€™s a great way to learn, to see how shitty youâ€™re going to do without losing a plant. DO THIS FOR TWO YEARS. Take whatever capital you have right now and buy some potatoes or solid ass fruit trees with minimal risk. Keep adding to it EVERY season. Build up some plants for when youâ€™re ready to garden for real. Take two years to learn how to garden, watch your Harvest Moon profile die a couple dozen times, read and follow the news, WSB, VeggiesRUs, etc. Ask questions, test out your strategies. Youâ€™ll thank me two years from now when your veggies moon.

**Tip 6 - Understand pests**

Big difference between insects and rodents. Moles loves your roots. Weeds are for suckers.

**Tip 7 - No one knows shit**

There is no crystal ball, no one has the â€œgreen thumbâ€, and only believe 10% of what you read. Be very fucking skeptical. About everything. Social media, ants, CEOs, news, all if it, be fucking skeptical. Itâ€™s all manipulation. Donâ€™t even trust John Deere. You are the guardian of your garden. Everyone wants to take veggies away from you. Understand that and you wonâ€™t get suckered so easily.

**Tip 8 - Learn to read fundamentals and understand valuations**

As much as gardening today feels like a casino, the underlying foundation of the garden is gardening, not gathering. With every seed you plant youâ€™re creating a piece of a lifeform. Learn to read fundamentals. Do they need water? Are they growing? Do they have diseases? How are their neighbors growing? Do they make more veggies today than they did 5 years ago? How will they make more? How do they return nutrients to the soil? And on and on and on. Learn motherfuckers. Veggies per plant. Single or multiple blooms. Stem strength. Soil pH. Figure out formulas for valuing plants. Is a cucumber plant worth it? Is a pumpkin plant undervalued? Planting blindly because big_dick_loser said so in a post is beyond idiotic. Just burn your plants, youâ€™ll have more fun.

**Tip 9 - Get rich schemes are for suckers**

Remove the bookmark for the Avocados. You ainâ€™t getting one anytime soon. Play fucking smart. Go long. Think in decades, not days. Youâ€™re not smart enough to garden once and provide veggies for life. Not long-term anyways. Most of you wonâ€™t grow any veggies over 10 years. So be fucking smart. Play Harvest Moon until you can consistently prove gains season after season. When youâ€™re ready to trade for real, dip in slowly. Fuck FOMO. Fuck YOLO. Remember, time is on your side. Compound that shit.

**Tip 10 - Discipline and dedication**

Like anything in life, to be successful you have to fucking work at it. Easy veggies never last. Dig in, learn, practice, rinse and repeat. Be motivated to learn how to garden, take the time to study, read, test and constantly improve. Be disciplined with your veggies. They are fucking hard to make, easy to lose. Protect that shit.

--

For those of you this resonates with, youâ€™ll be fine long term. Do the fucking work. For those of you who love chasing the fantasy, good luck, I mean it. Itâ€™s a tough fucking pill to swallow watching your account get dwindled down to zero. Nothing tastes worse that losing all your veggies.

**Tip 2 - Understand how tendies flow in the market**

Tendies flow to those bold enough to earn them. If volatile stocks and speculative ""investing"" scare you, go to [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) and park your money in an ETF.

**Tip 3 - Play for the short term**

The   most important rule you need to follow religiously is ALL COMPANIES  WILL EVENTUALLY GO OUT OF BUSINESS. If you look at the makeup of the  market from 1995 to now, you'll notice a glaring trend: 90% of companies  that were at the peak of the market then are now dust. You may get  lucky and pick a long term winner here and there, but understand that  hype is a bitch, there's always a bigger fish, and nothing lasts  forever. If you're not planning your bets with well defined entry and  exit points, you will end up diamond handing some losing play way too  long because your confirmation bias has convinced you that you found the  next Amazon in a sea of [pets.com](https://pets.com/)  stocks from a DD post on a forum that is self described as ""if 4chan  found a bloomberg terminal"". Picking individual stocks is for short term  gains. Park your money in an ETF or index fund if you want something  long term with an OK rate of return.

**Tip 4 - Time is not on your side (if you're yolo'ing options)**

Theta  gang always wins. They don't always win as big as others win, but they  always win. If you're trading short term options and you're not the one  benefiting from theta, don't be so greedy that you lose your profits to  theta decay and market volatility. A stock could end on a Friday just  barely OTM and ruin your account just to run up 20% the following Monday.

**Tip 5 - Paper Trading**

Paper  trading is a simulation. It behaves exactly like a real account with  real active data but itâ€™s all practice. DO THIS FOR ZERO SECONDS. Paper  trading to prepare for real trading is like a boxer only training for a  fight by hitting the heavy bag. It will help some, but it's nothing like  a real fight. Every person who says ""oh if only i had bought Apple 20 years ago I'd be a billionaire"" has never actually traded  anything risky because everyone who has knows that it's stupid to stare  at a 100% return or even a 20% return and not lock it in.

**Tip 6 - Understand taxes**

Plug that stuff in to turbotax and let the nerds figure this out for you.  Just remember that after each trade you make that actually earns money,  set aside some for Uncle Sam. But google ""wash sale"" if you get bored  between staring at futures and reading ""DD"" posts about chinese EV  startups.

**Tip 7 - No one knows shit**

You don't know shit. I don't know shit. Nobody knows shit. Why are you reading this?

**Tip 8 - Learn to read fundamentals and understand valuations**

Lol jk. If you're reading about company fundamentals, go park your  money in an index fund or ETF. Refer to tips 1, 3, and 7 for why this is  the right move.

**Tip 9 - Get rich schemes are for winners**

Refer  to tip 8. You're not here to try to guess which company will be the  next Amazon by 2050. You're hear to scalp sick gains and retire early.  If you're not shooting for at least a 3-5% monthly growth in your  portfolio, skip the hassle and park your money in an ETF or index fund.

**Tip 10 - Discipline and dedication**

Like   anything in life, to be successful you have to fucking work at it and  be incredibly lucky in being at the right place and right time. Be  disciplined in your entry and exit points for each play, but don't over  think shit.

\--

For   those of you this resonates with, I look forward to seeing the loss  porn on the next red market day. Do the  work. For those of you  who love chasing the fantasy of actually knowing what you're  doing, good luck, I  mean it. Itâ€™s a tough fucking pill to swallow  realizing that you're not some investing prodigy and that your hundreds  of hours of ""DD"" will woefully underperform the mouth breathers who hit a  couple of lucky plays and never have to work again in their lives.

Peace."

GME Explanation,1606790233,T-Car2001,74,"Alright listen up I'm about to give a basic explanation of the GME situation and why there is potential for a short squeeze (feel free to add more info in the comments). GME share price has been increasing steadily for the past few months. Every Release of a new console rapidly increases the price per share of GME such as in 2007 with the release of the PS3 and Xbox 360 and in 2013 with the release of the PS4 and Xbox 1, in both scenarios, the share price capped in the low 40's before falling back into the normal range. Before both of these ""console induced"" surges the price per share was $11 just check out this graph: 

[GME the last 20 years showing a surge of both console releases.](https://preview.redd.it/zhna7ifxjh261.png?width=814&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f82684f1e1f3e94ac1bb9b36373755589ecfd90)

As seen in this stock price history graph price per share drops dramatically a couple of months after each console release. This is just beginning with GME today. THE SHORT TO FLOAT PERCENTAGE OF GME AS OF RIGHT NOW IS 292.53% this is very important. Starting very soon there could be a short squeeze. Since the number of people short selling this stock is insanely high in today's market, there is a very good possibility of a short squeeze. As I said at the start share prices have been rising making short-sellers nervous, as the price increases due to the ""console induced"" surge (and other factors ill link later), the more short sellers will buy back their losses since they are at an infinite risk for loss of money. Since this is likely to cause all of the short sellers to buy back their shorts the insane 292.53% short to float ratio will come into play, this is what will cause the short squeeze... AS THE SHORT SELLERS BUY BACK IT WILL DRAMATICALLY RAISE THE PRICE PER SHARE CAUSING A MASSIVE GAIN IN PROFIT. this is very likely to be way higher than the previous $40 per share cap as seen in the last console surges. This is why a short squeeze is likely and this is why there are millions of more shares owned than on Friday's market close. This is only the start gentlemen and watch as this phenomenon plays out.

Here is the link for more info on the GME situation: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k32h0m/gme\_full\_story/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k32h0m/gme_full_story/)"

They've only had 1 quarter of positive cash in their entire existence (back in 2011). [https://ycharts.com/companies/APHA/free\_cash\_flow](https://ycharts.com/companies/APHA/free_cash_flow)

  
They grow 45000kg/q and sell a fraction of that and continue to use their unsold inventory (currently at 320M) to fluff their numbers every quarter.  You should expect a massive write down in the next couple of quarters

Their 350M in cash are ALL loans or convertible debenture so you can also expect more dilution in their future

Management likes to be aggressive with the valuation of their unsold tangible assets to the extent their auditors (PWC) called them out on it in their q4 fins.  Read page 3 : [https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aphria-Q4-2020-consolidated-financial-statements-w-Auditors-Report-7.29-0015.pdf](https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aphria-Q4-2020-consolidated-financial-statements-w-Auditors-Report-7.29-0015.pdf)

Their all in cost at C1.50 is really not that good

On top of which, Irwin got 18M this year (almost as much as what sweetwater is suppose to accrete to them)

Scalping is fine but keep a more critical eye if you are investing in them for the long term."

[StockDip] Salesforce Buying Slack? Yesplz!,1606784684,Wetter42,12,"Salesforce is buying slack.  Great news.  My company uses BOTH of those applications and they're both very promising, but what does that mean for the stock?  

Typically when company A buys company B, the company A's stock goes down while company B goes up.  Why?  This is because Company A is spending (typically) a LOT of money to acquire company B and Company B is good enough to get acquired.  

I don't forsee any type of Salesforce Slander hitting the news, and companys generally recover long-term after buying a company once it's discovered that the acquired company was a good investment.  

What does that mean for you?  Well if you're smart, that means research, but otherwise, that also means long term calls on Salesforce (if you can afford cause it's pricey af).

My first day at college and learning stocks.,1606784861,afi44,23,"Hey guys

I just wanted a share a story with you all, not sure if this kind of shit is allowed here, but I wanted to break up some of the PLTR threads and having some refreshing humor at my expense.  This is pretty funny, and a true story.  And ties in some stocks at the end.

So let me begin, I'm a heavy set M A N.  I am in my 30s, and went to college in my late 20s because I wanted to stop flipping burgers at Burger King and make something of myself.

So while I worked at Burger King at night, I went to school during the day.

So this is the story of my first day at college as a 28 something man.

As I was walking up the steps to the front door to get class, it is 2 sets of stairs and I am already sweatin'.  I see this 18 year old girl in front of me and I try to get into the same revolving door as her except I didn't realize it was meant for 1 person.  So as I get in there (heavy breathing) I am literally on top of this small girl on accident.  She lets out a verbal ""ugh"". And I start to backout as she is going forward and realize i'm too late and am committed at this point. (oh fuck) in order to refrain from grinding on her, I humped to the left and right trying to dodge her but she ended up slipping and her arm brushed against my sweaty arms and she got slimed.  This is a pic of the door for reference.  She screamed.

https://preview.redd.it/mi1357p73h261.png?width=1416&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07da41e22c32e3d1f322bf59fef5d378775388af

So she darted out disgusted at me, and saw I was going for the elevator (likely to avoid me she took the stairs).

I get to the third floor and lo and behold she's there getting out of the stairwell and I say ""good morning"" not realizing it's the same girl because I never looked at her in the eyes and gives me a dirty look.

So she goes into room 301 and I am looking for room 303.  However door 303 is locked, I ask a janitor what is going on I have class in 5 mins and he shrugs and says No Hablo Espanol and descends into the halls.  I saw a couple of 18/19 year olds naruto running into 301 and asked them what is going on with room 303? and they said, 303 has been moved to 301. 

It was PACKED and you guys won't believe it but, there was only 2 seats available, 1 table with the girl who sat in the center.  So either freaking way I would have to sit next to this girl I slimed.  

Honestly class was pretty unremarkable nothing too funny happened, sat there quietly.

However, after class... I am walking towards the elevator and she is probably 10 ft behind me and I hold the door for her.  She says to me, honest to god ""No."" 

""I'll take the next one.""

Went home defeated that day boys.  But after that, I had a finance class where I learned about trading stocks and we all made paper trade accounts.  Most of the little kiddies bought Google and Apple, I put every dime into AMD and got 1st place.  Good times."

"Meme stocks = Waves, the next one?",1606786551,Cold-Cash-1842,59,"These ultra fast, ultra high gain stocks come at ya like waves in the ocean.. they start small, in fact many start small and never amount to anything. But the ones that do build up speed, momentum and velocity do so at a ferocious speed. Some of them are giants and just like 60ft waves in the the Atlantic Ocean they crash just as intensely as they began.  PLTR is done. You have to admit that to yourself. It went from $10 to $30 in a month, why? Because of fundamentals?! Is that why you bought in? It wasnâ€™t why I did.  I got in at $11 (and out at $28) because of mostly luck and also because the IPO seemed like a non starter.  Or like it wanted to go but it didnâ€™t have the popularity? Idk... it doesnâ€™t matter.. what matters is the hundreds of thousands of orders at $15 caused the orders at $18 and those caused $23 etc... its a wave.  Itâ€™s driven by price and FOMO. NOTHING ELSE. 9.9 out of 10 people who own PLTR stock donâ€™t know how to say the name of the company. 
So apart from being on some high horse, what am I getting at?  Look for the waves that are beginning to brew. Ok so fundamentals are complicated and reading charts is for David Blaine but what about the meme stocks that might be next to pop? You could make a lifetime of money if you could learn to sense the wave, like once itâ€™s 10-15% started and learn to exit around the 80-90% of the waves peak.  Even if you just rode waves from 40%-70% of their total move... youâ€™d make good money.  How? Well thatâ€™s mostly up to us to figure out.  As millennials we pride ourselves on being masters of social media, communication and instant information... so we should be able to get a sense for whatâ€™s likely to be the next mover. It literally doesnâ€™t matter the ticker or what they make or what theyâ€™re worth. All that matters is that a bunch more people think they wonâ€™t be the last to click buy. Thatâ€™s all there is to it. 

Considering there are 1 million members here, youâ€™d think more people would be dropping more new tickers that weâ€™ve never heard of. Making more of a case for the weird and wonderful.

Donâ€™t be that dude splashing around in the ocean hoping the wave will start again. That shit is over.

[DD] GME earnings and option positioning,1606786753,KYJELLYTIME69,42,"Ok retards it's time to take a closer look at GME now that earnings are coming up on Dec 8th. First of all don't expect earnings beat from GME for this quarter, shortage of consoles and competition from Amazon and Walmart means GME's probably gonna post a disappointing report, they'll probably guide up and highlight their cleaner balance sheet and maybe even talk about restructuring like Ryan Cohen wanted but who knows what gonna happen. So yea it might dump after earnings. 

but we ain't here to ""invest"" fundamentally, we're here for the epic short squeeze.  I don't give a shit about their FCF or valuation based on whatever fuckhead analyst's model. Whatever happens after earnings, it's important that we diamond hand this baby and roll your calls instead of just selling it like a weak ass pussy. 

IV for options around earnings are huge at \~250%, so there's a good chance that a lot of you retards will get IV crushed (if you're worried buy your calls further out, closer to the money or just buy shares) 

What I noticed is that there's a huge open interest of 20k for Dec 18 $17 puts and 12k for Dec 18 $16.5 puts. OI for call options doesn't even compare. Lots of gay bears (or maybe it's a hedge idk)  gonna get IV crushed, which is actually more bullish than you think. Because when those puts expire worthless, MM is gonna close their hedges by BUYING BACK the stock that they shorted when they hedged those puts. This effect MIGHT be very noticeable EOD on Dec 18 2020. In fact, it's probably what happened to PLTR last Friday, when about 30% of all calls expired and MM sold their hedges as your calls expired worthless, leading to a dump.

Do what you will with this information, but MINIMUM pain for MM at that week dec 18 is situated right around the $17 mark, unless the MM gamma exposure changes.

"Believe it or not, you retards know what you're doing (Sort of)",1606789344,Reuslan,42,"Hey investors. I'm a 17-year-old senior in high school who used to watch videos on dropshipping and making money as a teenager practically 24/7. Stocks have become one of the most interesting things I've ever laid my eyes on and at about 15ish, and  I started to look into them right away. I watched countless random youtube videos trying to explain the stock market, and me being the clueless teen I am I had absolutely no idea wtf these random lines and charts meant and how they work.

Still haven't officially touched the market yet, but definitely going to soon. I've always been too afraid to lose my 1000 or so dollars I have saved up due to a bad market play. Luckily for me, my school has an Investing club. It's a group of 30 kids who are put into 5 groups and we are all doing a Stock Simulator on investopedia.com. Everyone starts with a million dollars and you make your plays whenever you want. The groups meet once a week and ""discuss"" what stocks to play and stuff like that. No discussion is really done because we're all awkward lazy teenagers who just care about weed and PS4 and so on. 

Then I discovered you idiots.

Since the beginning of September, I've been looking through and asking questions in the Daily Thread section. You guys obviously would always have mixed opinions on certain stocks, but I would pretty much just continue scrolling through the thread until I was convinced to do a play. I've also been constantly looking at the Hot DDs that are usually right below the Daily Discussion thread, and when I'm bored I sometimes go onto a completely different website to check out a different type of Hot DDs.

Just wanted to say that I am currently in first place out of the 30 students in my class, and its not even close. I've attached pictures of the rankings as well as my trade history. You'll see that my trade history is literally just stonks that are constantly talked about in the Discussion Thread and in DDs. 

Basically, if I see (Ticker)  ðŸš€  ðŸš€  ðŸš€ multiple times in the thread, I'd buy into it.

Will I end up losing and getting last place? Possibly. But it'll only happen based on you guys - because I've practically only listened to you guys for the past few months. 

So moral of the story - You guys are not as dumb as you think. r/wallstreetbets is superior to r/investing and the other boomer Reddits, but you already knew that.

10 garden tips for WSB Newbies,1606789745,reetourebel,12,"Reading through some of the posts I can see how a lot of newbies have FOMO (fear of missing out). Post after post of losers making huge returns. Everyone is getting rich but you. Boofuckinghoo. The smart gardener realizes itâ€™s all hype. Some of it works, most of it doesnâ€™t. To be successful you need to be able to recognize the difference and to do that, you need time, knowledge and practice.

Here are ten tips that can help you along the way.

**Tip 1 - You donâ€™t know shit**

Youâ€™re going to lose your veggies if you don't use good fertilizer: organic chicken shit. Donâ€™t get suckered by reading posts about guys who made 1000% return in 5 minutes using their own feces as fertilizer. For every one guy that posts his massive shit gains, 100+ suckers have lost their bowels due to crippling diarrhea. The first lesson to realize is that itâ€™s way easier to lose veggies in the garden than to make veggies. 

**Tip 2 - Understand how water flows in the garden**

Water moves from the topsoil to the bottomsoil, from the roots to the plant. Any dummy can water short term. But to make water long-term and truly grow a garden, you have to be armed with knowledge and a shit ton of irrigation equipment.

**Tip 3 - Play for the long term**

The most important rule you need to follow religiously is NEVER FUCKING LOSE VEGGIES. Grow it big, water it to the roots. Your top responsibility is protecting your plant. YOLO is a stupid play. 99% of you are going to plant at the wrong time with the wrong seeds. Calm the fuck down and work on a long term strategy. You have decades dummy.

**Tip 4 - Time is on your side, but not much else**

The garden never stops. The garden just churns and churns. Summer to winter, winter to summer, it just keeps on turning and turning. There are ALWAYS opportunities. Another tomato plant. Another mint plant. FOMO is for fools. Miss a planting season? Big fucking deal. Thereâ€™s another one around the corner. You have plenty of time to learn, test, and grow your veggies.

**Tip 5 - Harvest Moon for N64**

Harvest Moon is a simulation. It behaves exactly like a real garden with real active plants but itâ€™s all practice. No real veggies grow. Itâ€™s a great way to learn, to see how shitty youâ€™re going to do without losing a plant. DO THIS FOR TWO YEARS. Take whatever capital you have right now and buy some potatoes or solid ass fruit trees with minimal risk. Keep adding to it EVERY season. Build up some plants for when youâ€™re ready to garden for real. Take two years to learn how to garden, watch your Harvest Moon profile die a couple dozen times, read and follow the news, WSB, VeggiesRUs, etc. Ask questions, test out your strategies. Youâ€™ll thank me two years from now when your veggies moon.

**Tip 6 - Understand pests**

Big difference between insects and rodents. Moles loves your roots. Weeds are for suckers.

**Tip 7 - No one knows shit**

There is no crystal ball, no one has the â€œgreen thumbâ€, and only believe 10% of what you read. Be very fucking skeptical. About everything. Social media, ants, CEOs, news, all if it, be fucking skeptical. Itâ€™s all manipulation. Donâ€™t even trust John Deere. You are the guardian of your garden. Everyone wants to take veggies away from you. Understand that and you wonâ€™t get suckered so easily.

**Tip 8 - Learn to read fundamentals and understand valuations**

As much as gardening today feels like a casino, the underlying foundation of the garden is gardening, not gathering. With every seed you plant youâ€™re creating a piece of a lifeform. Learn to read fundamentals. Do they need water? Are they growing? Do they have diseases? How are their neighbors growing? Do they make more veggies today than they did 5 years ago? How will they make more? How do they return nutrients to the soil? And on and on and on. Learn motherfuckers. Veggies per plant. Single or multiple blooms. Stem strength. Soil pH. Figure out formulas for valuing plants. Is a cucumber plant worth it? Is a pumpkin plant undervalued? Planting blindly because big_dick_loser said so in a post is beyond idiotic. Just burn your plants, youâ€™ll have more fun.

**Tip 9 - Get rich schemes are for suckers**

Remove the bookmark for the Avocados. You ainâ€™t getting one anytime soon. Play fucking smart. Go long. Think in decades, not days. Youâ€™re not smart enough to garden once and provide veggies for life. Not long-term anyways. Most of you wonâ€™t grow any veggies over 10 years. So be fucking smart. Play Harvest Moon until you can consistently prove gains season after season. When youâ€™re ready to trade for real, dip in slowly. Fuck FOMO. Fuck YOLO. Remember, time is on your side. Compound that shit.

**Tip 10 - Discipline and dedication**

Like anything in life, to be successful you have to fucking work at it. Easy veggies never last. Dig in, learn, practice, rinse and repeat. Be motivated to learn how to garden, take the time to study, read, test and constantly improve. Be disciplined with your veggies. They are fucking hard to make, easy to lose. Protect that shit.

--

For those of you this resonates with, youâ€™ll be fine long term. Do the fucking work. For those of you who love chasing the fantasy, good luck, I mean it. Itâ€™s a tough fucking pill to swallow watching your account get dwindled down to zero. Nothing tastes worse that losing all your veggies.

Peace."

10 Brown tips for WSB Newbies,1606790021,codemonkey14,13,"Reading   through some of the posts I can see how some of you think so highly of yourselves that a single red day in a rocket ship stock market makes you feel like you're the next Warren Burry. Post after post  of losers making huge returns.  Everyone is getting rich but you.  Boofuckinghoo. The smart investor  realizes itâ€™s all an elaborate side  stepping of online casino laws. Some of it works, most of it doesnâ€™t. To be successful, you need to be able to recognize the difference and to  do that, you need hype, lots of money, and a cushy day job to fall back  on when you blow up your life savings on a YOLO.

Here are ten tips that can help you along the way.

**Tip 1 - You donâ€™t know shit**

But that's fine, because nobody else does either.

**Tip 2 - Understand how tendies flow in the market**

Tendies flow to those bold enough to earn them. If volatile stocks and speculative ""investing"" scare you, go to [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) and park your money in an ETF.

**Tip 3 - Play for the short term**

The   most important rule you need to follow religiously is ALL COMPANIES  WILL EVENTUALLY GO OUT OF BUSINESS. If you look at the makeup of the  market from 1995 to now, you'll notice a glaring trend: 90% of companies  that were at the peak of the market then are now dust. You may get  lucky and pick a long term winner here and there, but understand that  hype is a bitch, there's always a bigger fish, and nothing lasts  forever. If you're not planning your bets with well defined entry and  exit points, you will end up diamond handing some losing play way too  long because your confirmation bias has convinced you that you found the  next Amazon in a sea of [pets.com](https://pets.com/)  stocks from a DD post on a forum that is self described as ""if 4chan  found a bloomberg terminal"". Picking individual stocks is for short term  gains. Park your money in an ETF or index fund if you want something  long term with an OK rate of return.

**Tip 4 - Time is not on your side (if you're yolo'ing options)**

Theta  gang always wins. They don't always win as big as others win, but they  always win. If you're trading short term options and you're not the one  benefiting from theta, don't be so greedy that you lose your profits to  theta decay and market volatility. A stock could end on a Friday just  barely OTM and ruin your account just to run up 20% the following Monday.

**Tip 5 - Paper Trading**

Paper  trading is a simulation. It behaves exactly like a real account with  real active data but itâ€™s all practice. DO THIS FOR ZERO SECONDS. Paper  trading to prepare for real trading is like a boxer only training for a  fight by hitting the heavy bag. It will help some, but it's nothing like  a real fight. Every person who says ""oh if only i had bought Apple 20 years ago I'd be a billionaire"" has never actually traded  anything risky because everyone who has knows that it's stupid to stare  at a 100% return or even a 20% return and not lock it in.

**Tip 6 - Understand taxes**

Plug that stuff in to turbotax and let the nerds figure this out for you.  Just remember that after each trade you make that actually earns money,  set aside some for Uncle Sam. But google ""wash sale"" if you get bored  between staring at futures and reading ""DD"" posts about chinese EV  startups.

**Tip 7 - No one knows shit**

You don't know shit. I don't know shit. Nobody knows shit. Why are you reading this?

**Tip 8 - Learn to read fundamentals and understand valuations**

Lol jk. If you're reading about company fundamentals, go park your  money in an index fund or ETF. Refer to tips 1, 3, and 7 for why this is  the right move.

**Tip 9 - Get rich schemes are for winners**

Refer  to tip 8. You're not here to try to guess which company will be the  next Amazon by 2050. You're hear to scalp sick gains and retire early.  If you're not shooting for at least a 3-5% monthly growth in your  portfolio, skip the hassle and park your money in an ETF or index fund.

**Tip 10 - Discipline and dedication**

Like   anything in life, to be successful you have to fucking work at it and  be incredibly lucky in being at the right place and right time. Be  disciplined in your entry and exit points for each play, but don't over  think shit.

\--

For   those of you this resonates with, I look forward to seeing the loss  porn on the next red market day. Do the  work. For those of you  who love chasing the fantasy of actually knowing what you're  doing, good luck, I  mean it. Itâ€™s a tough fucking pill to swallow  realizing that you're not some investing prodigy and that your hundreds  of hours of ""DD"" will woefully underperform the mouth breathers who hit a  couple of lucky plays and never have to work again in their lives.

Peace."

GME Explanation,1606790233,T-Car2001,74,"Alright listen up I'm about to give a basic explanation of the GME situation and why there is potential for a short squeeze (feel free to add more info in the comments). GME share price has been increasing steadily for the past few months. Every Release of a new console rapidly increases the price per share of GME such as in 2007 with the release of the PS3 and Xbox 360 and in 2013 with the release of the PS4 and Xbox 1, in both scenarios, the share price capped in the low 40's before falling back into the normal range. Before both of these ""console induced"" surges the price per share was $11 just check out this graph: 

[GME the last 20 years showing a surge of both console releases.](https://preview.redd.it/zhna7ifxjh261.png?width=814&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f82684f1e1f3e94ac1bb9b36373755589ecfd90)

As seen in this stock price history graph price per share drops dramatically a couple of months after each console release. This is just beginning with GME today. THE SHORT TO FLOAT PERCENTAGE OF GME AS OF RIGHT NOW IS 292.53% this is very important. Starting very soon there could be a short squeeze. Since the number of people short selling this stock is insanely high in today's market, there is a very good possibility of a short squeeze. As I said at the start share prices have been rising making short-sellers nervous, as the price increases due to the ""console induced"" surge (and other factors ill link later), the more short sellers will buy back their losses since they are at an infinite risk for loss of money. Since this is likely to cause all of the short sellers to buy back their shorts the insane 292.53% short to float ratio will come into play, this is what will cause the short squeeze... AS THE SHORT SELLERS BUY BACK IT WILL DRAMATICALLY RAISE THE PRICE PER SHARE CAUSING A MASSIVE GAIN IN PROFIT. this is very likely to be way higher than the previous $40 per share cap as seen in the last console surges. This is why a short squeeze is likely and this is why there are millions of more shares owned than on Friday's market close. This is only the start gentlemen and watch as this phenomenon plays out.

Here is the link for more info on the GME situation: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k32h0m/gme\_full\_story/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k32h0m/gme_full_story/)"

How to use WSB and StockTwits to Make Fortunes,1606790599,stocktawk,24,"Well Iâ€™ve been crash testing this theory. 7 days now

Almost 100% winning trades. Amounting to around 25 trades. I can provide all screenshots

Use WSB as a baseline to pick the stock

If WSB is trending the stock- make note of it. the list of stocks goes on and on. But I wonâ€™t post them because most are prob banned tickers. 

And hereâ€™s how I keep making money. 

This canâ€™t fail

- If WSB is talking about it. Good. Baseline stock
- If stocktwits starts trending it. Buy 10 shares. 
- THE MOMENT IT TRENDS BUY THEM. 
- stock needs to be less than $10 and also up more than 50% on its current price
- If the amount of people watching it on stocktwits goes up, while sentiment and Msg Volume also begin to swing wildly, buy 10 more shares. 

Iâ€™ve done this 6 trading days in a row. Tomorrow will be 7. 

It canâ€™t fail. I havenâ€™t gone big yet tho."

A Bright Future for Maxar Technologies $MAXR,1606792254,rblayzor,12,"A Bright Future for Maxar Technologies $MAXR

Ever use Google earth? Chances are you have used one of Maxarâ€™s satellites to view images of the Earth. 

This company creates satellites and satellite-software for global Earth imaging. Recently, they have taken on several contracts with the US Government, specifically the state department, for homeland security. 

Maxar has been doing serious balance-sheet strengthening and significant improvements to the way they create value. Recently, they have been paying out a dividend, although small at .01, it shows that the balance sheet is strong from a sustainable flow of cash. Net income has also been on the rise. The PE ratio is very low, coming in at around 5. Having a market cap of 1.7B I see plenty of room for growth in the share price, and it seems investors are undermining this companyâ€™s future potential.

Maxar is also a great acquisition target. Lockheed, Raytheon and even Boeing could be possible contenders for a Maxar acquisition.

Do your own research, and youâ€™ll see why this is such a great value."

SPY bottomed out .75% from its consolidation channel before entering back into it. 

[Here's the excerpt from last post:](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3cydq/spy_recap_nio_amd_and_tsla_ta_or_a_wsbs_wet_dream/)

&gt;Monday will be the start of SPYâ€™s 4th day of consolidation, so something has to give IMO, but she could consolidate on Monday, so watch out for pump fakes. You may want to extend the consolidation channel to be safe. However, if SPY breaks out, expect a 1-2% movement in either direction, as highlighted below.  
&gt;  
&gt;If current support fails, look out for 361-360 and below for PUTS to print.

AMD popped out of the gate, and hit about 90 ish. It quickly topped and fell back down to the opening price. AMD took a steady climb up to 93 ish the rest of the day.

&gt;""If AMD punches through 87.18 resistance finds and news support, you could look at a 90c exp. 12/11 and hope that it hits between 90-93.2+ and trim. Maybe even leave a runner for a lotto.  
&gt;  
&gt;If AMD bounces around that price point, you could look at scalping an 87p and trim at that price point, leaving a runner if she breaks to 85-83.  
&gt;  
&gt;If AMD finds support at around 87.18 and bounces, you could look for another 90-92c weekly. At that time, you could dump all your savings and play a late December lotto 98c like to true degen that you are.""

Look for AMD to trade in the 90-96 range tomorrow. It shouldn't go any lower than 89 ish IMO. Anything lower than 87 ish and AMD will fall to 86-83.

* If AMD breaks support on its uptrend channel, expect a 3% drop. If it breaks at 92.16 ish, then expect a drop to 89.18 ish. If it breaks at 93.51 ish, then expect a drop to 90.59 ish. If it breaks at around 95 ish, then expect a drop to 91 ish. 
* 89p, 90p, 91p 11/4 will be the plays, depending on where or if AMD drops out of its uptrend channel.
* Trim and leave runner at price target or bottoms. I don't think we drop lower than 87.18 tomorrow, but leave a runner for the lotto in case we do.

**11/30 - 12/3 TSLA TA or When Will TSLA slow down?**

TSLA opened at 602.21 and fell to 554.51, and rebounded to 567.60.

TSLA could hold support at 62 ish and fell hard to 554 before quickly rebounding. It topped out at 558 ish in the morning and took the stairs to 565 ish before bouncing to 592 ish. 

The recommended playbook was right on the money from the last post, so if you got in on it, then congratulations. If you got greedy and double dipped, then YOU GOT BIG BRAIN. If not, what the hell were you thinking. 

[Here's the excerpt from post:](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3cydq/spy_recap_nio_amd_and_tsla_ta_or_a_wsbs_wet_dream/)

&gt;If TSLA breaks support, you could scalp a 575p 12/4 exp. and trim at bottom or around 567.72, leaving a lotto runner for 554.55 and below ***(0.14 from today's bottom).***  
&gt;  
&gt;If TLA holds support on uptrend on monday or Tuesday, you could dump your entire life savings into a 620c 12/11 and watch TSLA hitt 700.

TSLA Plays for 12/1:

* I'm expecting TSLA to close around 605-617 ish so keep the 620c 12/11 that I told you to buy. 
* If TSLA holds current support, look for 605c 11/4. Trim at the target or at top and leave a runner for 617+
* The line in the sand is really 593.43 IMO. 
* TSLA could bounce off 605 ish if it makes it and drop to 588 ish and below. Scalping a 585p or 580p might be worthwhile. Trim and leave a runner for 576 ish and below. 
* If current support fails, look for 588, 580, and 576 price targets. It TSLA breaks through 576.90 ish then expect it to fall near 552 ish IMO. 552 ish is danger zone for TSLA so be careful if it gets there.

* If current resistance holds look for a test at 49.66. If it fails then NIO could fall to 48.62 ish.

CARR (Global Carrier) must Buy Now DD,1606792704,Either_Loan_6516,29,Recent posts have been right last week on GME and Dollar General now onto the next play. Global Carrier is a HVAC/Refrigerator company. Best in the business. IPO was back in April. Gradual incline over the past few months with no little downward movement. Company has been meeting and exceeding earnings every time. Small divined of payment not a lot but still something. But the real sauce...When Moderna and Pfizer get approval next week from FDA which is going to happen the distribution is going to be complicated. The one company that can handle a majority of this is right here. Guarantee the government will back distribution in America and will pay a huge amount for this to happen safety and effectively. Wonâ€™t be a bidding war they will choose the best company and that CARR. Other countries will do the same especially in Europe and this company is world wide. Price target is 45$ or more by December 18th. Why is this important. Options are cheap due to low IV. That is all.

"""GameStop is the Real Game, not just the place you go to buy Games""",1606792960,RobinhoodAtWork,11,"I thought about this a lot and the truth has revealed itself to me!

I've had an incredible revelation and I must tell all you mother fuckers!

This is just like WestWorld that TV show where the rich tourists go and they think the game is being in a Western Animatronics World and they can do sick stuff like kill people and rape and gamble and drink and ride horses. That's the game but the real, deeper, hidden game is the circle puzzle William is trying to solve. Williams done all the face value stuff over and over and then he realized that there's something more there. The puzzle maze under the scalp of the Indian.

That's the same idea with what's going on with GameStop!  The game isn't the next, new game you're going to buy from GameStop like CyberPunk 2077 or the next game console like the XBox Series X or PS5, No! the game is embedded in the GameStop Stock. The real, hidden game with GameStop is played with the GameStop Stock. The Game is to buy the stock and hold and wait for the squeeze. That's the game. In order to win, we need to wait for the squeeze. And put all our faith and money in GME and wait for this squeeze event to happen and have it happen. That's the Game. That's the entire purpose for all of GameStop's 5,000 stores! That's why GameStop was founded when video games became popular in North America in the 1990s! That's why all of this happened. It sounds absolutely crazy but it's true. It was all done by the makers and architects to bring us to this point. To this once in a 7 year console cycle that has begun a new again this November. It's also why Blockbuster, the rental company even existed and went bankrupt in the first place. It was all planned by our architects so that GameStop could be compared to BlockBuster so that certain people working at large financial companies would be compelled to short the stock to over 100% with their customer's money. This all sounds completely bananas and conspiratorial but it is all true. This squeeze event will be an event that will marry heaven and earth and reveal all secrets and lead to orgastic joy and pleasure and warm happiness for everyone in humanity. We will be rewarded 1000x over not just in monetary terms but also emotionally for brining about this once in the world / galaxy / time and space event!

GME is the Most WSB Move in the History of WSB,1606793018,ptrader99,96,"Think about it...

1. Declining macro environment â˜‘ï¸ - GME is a brick and mortar retailer in the age of e-commerce whose demise was nearly certain before COVID-19, and then COVID-19 accelerated the process. 
2. Rapidly declining revenue â˜‘ï¸ -  YoY quarterly revenue growth has been negative for past 5 quarters.
3. Business model not becoming more efficient in digital era â˜‘ï¸ - Gross margin has steadied around 28% since 2018.
4. ""Smart money"" betting against the stock â˜‘ï¸ - Hedge funds actively betting against GME's survival with short % of float at 297.3% (as of Nov 13).
5. Familiar (and I assume identifiable) movie character, stock genius backing it â˜‘ï¸ - Michael Burry notoriously bet against the rest of ""smart money"" and the housing market in the Financial Crisis of '08 famously depicted by The Big Short.

In the face of a dismal macro environment and worsening company fundamentals, you retards of WSB have bucked any sort of common sense and relied on each other to squeeze Wall Street's nuts and sent GME to levels not seen since late 2017. In the process, WSB has funneled $s upon $s from top Wall Street hedge funds, minted several millionaires, and multiplied many more retards' net worth. Embodiment of Robinhood in its finest form. As an innocent bystander, I fear for the future of some of your portfolios, but I get that ""as long as the music playing, you've got to get up and dance."" I just hope you've distanced yourself from the punchbowl and are eyeing the exit. Til the break of dawn yo!"
C3.ai IPO same week as DASH,1606793063,Incarnegie,19,"  

[**C3.AI**](https://C3.AI)

Seems like a potential buy, any more information is welcome. Here is my DD. 

Week of December 7th, 2020

NYSE Price range $31-$34, 15.5M Shares. Ticker â€œAiâ€

They have a partnership with Microsoft, Bank of America, Koch Industries, AstraZeneca, U.S Air Force, Army Aviation, U.S Strategic Command from California. 

Most recently valued at 3.3 BN. C3.AI research teams were awarded a $1m grant in April to develop mathematical models to predict COVID-19 spread. They have pledged to spend $367m over the next 5 years to find ways to slow the ongoing impact of COVID-19. 

Underwriters are Morgan Stanley, J.P Morgan, and Bank of America. 

Underwriters are offered an additional 2.33 million shares. Koch Industries has agreed to purchase $100m of common stock. Microsoft has agreed to buy $50m of common stock. 

After IPO C3.ai will have roughly 99.2m shares ($33.20 share midpoint). Siebel will retain 72% of voting power after IPO.

The company being valued at 3.08-3.3 BN goes down if the underwriters do not exercise their purchase option. Down by about 70-80m.

Calculating what the GME price should be for shorters to get in the red,1606793643,maxfort86,53,"Assumptions:

A person/institution borrows N shares from a broker at time t=0, at the price of P\_0 per share, and with interest rate r. Equivalently, the shorter has borrowed N\*P\_0 dollars.

The person/institution can cover the share (buy back the share and return it to the broker)  after T periods at the price of P\_T, and make a gross profit (not considering the costs of borrowing) of N(P\_0 -  P\_T)

The costs to the shorter: interest paid + opportunity cost of what could have been done with the money (let's say buying an index ETF with an R% annual return is a relatively safe alternative).

So in the end, the shorter makes a loss if:

gains &lt; costs

N \* (P\_0 - P\_T) &lt; N \* P\_0 \* \[ (1 + r + R)\^T - 1\]

Cancel out N from both sides:

(P\_0 - P\_T) &lt; P\_0 \* \[ (1 + r + R)\^T - 1\]

Let's give our parameters numbers. If the shorter started their position in Nov 2015 (5 years ago, so T=5) when the price of GME was $40 per share, with an interest rate of r = 5% per year and the opportunity cost (the return on an index fund) being R = 4%, solve for P\_T

40 - P\_T &lt; 40 \* \[(1 + 0.05 + 0.04)\^5 - 1\]

40 - P\_T &lt; 40 \* 0.54

40 - P\_T &lt; 21.5

P\_T &gt; 18.5

So for this shorter who started its position at such a high price ($40) 5 years ago, the price should go above $18.5 to get them in the red.

This could explain why they fought so hard to keep the price below $18 today.

Feel free to play with numbers for shorters who may have entered their position at different times (and so different prices)."

Profiting off of peopleâ€™s pain and suffering (ASPS),1606793791,mojo108,55,"  

What up retards, got a potential 2021 bagger where you can exchange your soul for some cheap OTM calls. 

Altisource (ASPS) is a real estate company that profits off of servicing foreclosures. Back in 2008 this fucker went from $5 to over $150 a share, and I think we might get a similar run in 2021. As of November 7.65%, of all Mortgages are delinquent, this is actually a higher figure than back in 2008. 

Right now the CARES Act is keeping the housing market afloat but as mortgage forbearance begins to end weâ€™ll most likely see a wave of foreclosures and possibly a huge run. Iâ€™m banking on some deep OTM calls on this one.

Tesla joining the S&amp;P will crash the market. I promise Iâ€™m not a ðŸŒˆ ðŸ».,1606793912,rjc0915,9,"We might be retarded but we all know Tesla is set to join the S&amp;P 500 December 21st. And what some of us retards may know is that there are over $11 Trillion in mutual funds, $4.5 trillion of which are passive index funds where dumbass boomers throw their money. 

When Tesla joins the S&amp;P all of these funds will be forced to buy Tesla shares to continue following the index. A bidding war will drive this share through the roof. With the recent news this transition will take place over a single day as opposed to multiple like previously suggested, the volume (and therefore volatility) will soar. Along with your options. Ultimate tendies. But weâ€™re all aware of this. Get your ass in Tesla now or risk becoming a full retard.

What isnâ€™t talked about is how the money will be transferred into Tesla. The index is passive (not active like you dipshits following tickers all day). This means that shares that follow the S&amp;P now will be forced to sell in order to make room for Tesla.

Almost every stock within the S&amp;P will have shares sold off, driving the price down. With the S&amp;P tanking this will trigger the already unstable economy weâ€™re in. Congress is already trying to pass more legislation to limit techâ€™s reach, as well as stopping China imports of goods made in concentration camps. Iâ€™ve ridden this pump but we all see covid making another impact, and a market that can only be supported by the fed for so long. The bubble will burst, but we will feast.

Iâ€™m buying calls all the way up to Tesla joining, but holding SPY puts through the new year. Join me in this rollercoaster weâ€™re about to experience fuckers.

The VTGN Pipeline,1606795586,TwisterBC89,8,"Two weeks after VistaGen Therapeutics released promising earnings, analysts have upgraded their price target over 200% to $4 per share (currently $0.75). This biopharmaceutical company is about to make waves in the industry with their new CNS drugs. As analysts are optimistic about the near future of VTGN, one thing they left out of their report was the drug Pipeline that is about to make VTGN's value enormous.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-beat-vistagen-therapeutics-inc-140741371.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-beat-vistagen-therapeutics-inc-140741371.html)

In their CNS (Central Nervous System) pipeline, they have 3 new drugs which go beyond the current standard for the care of anxiety, depression, and other CNS disorders which have been spiking in cases as a result of the novel Coronavirus. In this Pipeline, they have 3 drugs all past Phase 2, with one currently in Phase 3 (final stage) of testing.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.vistagen.com\/pipeline](https://preview.redd.it/fzianwxm2i261.png?width=1206&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b4cd8bcc47678ab7a2a1356942f34ca76c82d33)

These innovative drugs combined with the design of a nasal spray, makes it easier to treat anxiety disorders without the harmful side effects and consequences of using Benzodiazepines - drugs which have been proven to cause memory loss, nausea, sight problems, and blood disorders.

[https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/drugs-and-treatments/sleeping-pills-and-minor-tranquillisers/side-effects-of-benzodiazepines/](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/drugs-and-treatments/sleeping-pills-and-minor-tranquillisers/side-effects-of-benzodiazepines/)

As testing of their Phase 3 has been going on for months and showing promising results, they may be releasing the data of their study soon and possibly by the end of the quarter or their next earnings report in early February. With these massive medications under development, there is an excellent chance a positive result from a phase 3 study would push this company well above $4 per share."

Right now $PEN is facing lots of legal trouble due to their Xtra Flex catheter killing and injuring several people. This summer it was announced that they will be facing lots of legal issues from this. Also, late this summer the company's CEO/President sold around $1.5 million worth of $PEN stock. You're probably thinking ""why the fuck has penumbra jumped up $100 since summer if all that shit happened"", honestly I don't know either, but recently a lot more people are finding out about whats happening and after hedge fund manager Gabriel Grego brought up that $PEN is going to shit its been a red day every day for the stock. It will definitely drop lower.

Bollinger Bands are NOT Astrology - Use Them to Time Your Moves,1606801557,lalfred,26,"A lot of you fuckers shit on TA, but Bollinger bands are actually great for letting you know when a stock is actually breaking out instead of just temporarily overbought or oversold, especially when combined with relatively high volume.

It represents a range of (usually) plus or minus 2 standard deviations above a moving average, which is (usually) set at 20 periods. You probably don't care about that because I know that none of you can do statistics anyway, but you should. Why? It basically indicates is that **95% of the time, significant movement outside of the bands is not going to last**. This is incredibly useful for timing entry points and exit points throughout the day.

What I've found is that **a significant jump outside of the range created by the Bollinger bands is usually followed by a reversal, allowing you to maximize your profits** on exit by selling at a peak or on entry by buying at a trough. Let's use everyone's favorite meme stock of the week as an example. Focus on the examples circled in white for now.

[PLTR, the morning of 11\/30, 1-minute candlestick graph with Bollinger bands](https://preview.redd.it/o8popcybei261.jpg?width=1557&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf8a85fc29173930ba5e0b9632a5b5f42cc77a2c)

In each of the pairs of white circles, there is significant movement outside of the bands and relatively high volume, which is followed by either a retracement or a reversal. The first and last pairs show the stock price extending more significantly beyond the Bollinger bands for longer periods of time, along with relatively higher volume than the middle two examples. Here, the first and last pairs are reversals, while the middle two pairs are retracements. **The stronger the signals, the more likely it is to be a legitimate reversal instead of a retracement**. If you want to, you can combine this with other indicators like RSI if you know what you're doing, but volume is a pretty good indicator of signal strength on its own.

On the other hand, if the stock price steadily hugs one of the bands, it usually indicates a legitimate trend. You can use this to hop on an uptrend if you're buying, or to cut your losses if you're selling. The magenta example shows a clear downtrend. Note that the stock price hugs the lower band, never falling significantly below it. It's accompanied by relatively high volume, so you know that the signal is strong.

I've only been trading for 7 months, but I've been doing much better since I've started paying attention to these indicators. I pretty much only use the 1-minute graph with this, although it can likely be applied to other relatively short periods too. I'm not saying this will let you see every reversal before it happens like some sort of psychic, but it's a hell of a lot better than flying blind. Start using them, you can thank me later.

HOW TO WIN THE $GME WAR - Strategy Discussion,1606801603,m-bae,6,"ok HERE ME OUT... but I think we doing this wrong (or at least more autistically than necessary). 

We want to pump $GME and force the short-sellers into a squeeze so we can pump this shit to the moon and get our tendies, no? 

Well I think there is a better (or at least less financially painful way) for us all to do our part. 

*What do we know?* 

* We know that there are more short positions than shares outstanding.
* We know GME has 100 million in cash for stock buybacks but will most likely not exercise to avoid giving Ryan Cohen (founder of [Chewy.com](https://Chewy.com) that bought 9.98% of all $GME shares &amp; doesn't like the way the board is running shit) control over the company/board. 
* We know Michael Burry (Big Short legend) has a massive position (his second largest) and also seems to be invested in the short squeeze theory.  

*Our Current Strategy:* 

As of now, the hive mind has decided that we collectively yolo our life savings randomly (at random times) in random ways, leaving some of our comrades alone on the field, wounded with loss porn. 

&amp;#x200B;

*My Suggested Strategy:* 

We could force the short sellers to buy exponentially more shares to cover their shorts by increasing the risk/probability by buying DEEP OTM weekly call options. 

STORYTIME: 

Remember the $AAPL / $TSLA rally that dominated July and August? Well, there is consensus that there was a reason the squeezes were so aggressive and constant was the insane buying of these short expiry DEEP OTM call options by a few autists (myself included) and SOFTBANK. 

Since institutions/market makers have to follow risk practices, most have to buy stocks to protect their positions - the higher the implied volatility, the more stock they have to buy... aka 100shares X \~imagine\~. As the demand rises for short-dated DEEP OTM call options so does the ""likelihood"" due to the increase in implied vol, forcing them to buy not in the 100s but 100,000s due to the increase in risk. Basically, you are forcing their hand far more aggressively than you ever could by just buying the stock itself.

&amp;#x200B;

So (theoretically), if we want to win the war, we need to be fighting with bombs not swords. 

AKA deep OTM weekly call options instead of simply pumping shares."

ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ **DD - Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, Ltd ($PSTH)** ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

In recent weeks there has been a lot of interesting action in the stock market as it relates to $PSTH. Despite a lot of noise and speculation (if one were to go looking), the major news outlets and press have been quiet. This DD makes the argument (based on the available evidence) that Bill Ackmanâ€™s blank cheque company, PSTH, will announce a merger with Stripe, securing a \~10-20% position in the company and taking it public.

This can be discredited as conjecture, but most things on WSB can be and are before they are realized. There is simply too much evidence here in favor of this happening to be ignored any longer.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Key Information/Timeline of Events:**

\- In July 2020, Bill Ackman went live with SPAC $PSTH â€“ the SPAC raised $4B in proceeds with the option to take it to $7B making it the biggest SPAC ever.

\- The SPAC is designed very differently than others and incentivizes long term holding. Upon purchase of one common share and holding of that share through announcement and merger, owners receive 2/9 of a warrant with a strike of $23. Those who buy and sell on announcement bounce therefore give up that 2/9 and it goes back into the pool for those who hold through merger. What a lot of people are missing is what this means. It means that the ceiling for the value of that fractional warrant is unknown but at minimum is 2/9. If there was a minority sell off on announcement that 2/9 could increase to 3/9 or 4/9 warrant for those who stay in. This creates a wild incentive for long term holding of the company and is referenced in the ""tontine"" name - look it up, pretty cool.

\- Ackman has given several interviews since the listing of PSTH arguing that they are very well positioned to target and capture a unicorn (large cap, well run, asset light, family owned, high moat, company.) Early speculation included AirBnB. While Ackman held talks with the company, they didnâ€™t get to the point where his people got an inside look at the financials and he basically said they had no idea what they were dealing with despite liking how the company looked on the outside.

\- Ackman in the same videos talked up Stripe as a quality company but one not ready to go public, specifically citing managerial deficits.

\- Stripe has been talked up by some in the press as the next Google. They control a large percentage of online payments at present.

\- Ackman has publicly disclosed his biggest misses as companies that make money based on money, giving Visa/Mastercard as the obvious example.

**- In the weeks since those interviews, several key events have taken place as follows:**

o Following Ackman comments, Stripe initiates a dramatic position filling hiring spree with focus on positions needed to go public/SPAC

o Square executive joins board of PSTH

o **Seth Klarman** ($30B hedge fund manager â€œthe next Buffetâ€ and noted value investor, disclosed a $400M position in PSTH).

o **Guuggenheim** buys 22,000,000 $PSTH shares

o **Warren Buffet** has slashed his JPM position almost entirely potentially signifying a shift towards other financials? With online sales through the roof (this is just getting press in the last 2-3 days in earnest), he could be making a final gigantic long-term play for $BRK before he passes away). What better choice than a money maker based on money.

o Warren Buffet is secretly building a large position and hiding it from the press/pushing filing deadlines as much as possible. $BRK on record saying they want in on energy or tech giant.

o There is a large and undisclosed PSTH somewhere in the market that is not Klarmanâ€™s.

o In recent days the pre-market movement has been very odd. Several million positions. Pre-market on Friday for example, stock was up nearly **9%** for some of the morning. Has consistently hit after-market highs the next day. The data is trending in a very clear direction.

o The most cited (and really only) example of why this won't be Stripe is some troll that one of the brothers made on twitter. If they are indeed in negotiations, or getting ready to re-present to PSTH given all their new hiring, and given PSTH work in securing top of the line investors (**Klarman, Guggenheim, Blackstone, Ontario Teacher's Union**), this wouldn't be a bad negotiation tactic. They know the PSTH offer must come with some concessions.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This ends his post, now lets take a look at his points one by one that are relevant to STRIPE.

1. Stripe is a quality company but one that is not yet ready to go public. How is this conjecture even mildly relevant to him hinting at a possible stripe acquisition? He said himself that he is looking for a mature company, and Bill himself believes that Free Cash Flow is number one when looking into a company. Stripe does not fit this bill.
2. Stripe has been talked up by some in the press as the next google. That's great, and? There are a plethora of upcoming tech companies, seemingly more everyday, that are being praised as the next google. Praising a company as good and comparing it to a titan which it is not similar too in almost any way is not relevant for the point that is trying to be made. 
3. Ackman has publicly disclosed his biggest misses as companies that make money based on money. He has publicly disclosed that he has made mistakes missing companies that make money in a manner similar to this in the past. SEVERAL TIMES. Why do you believe he won't do it again?

4 and 5. o Following Ackman comments, Stripe initiates a dramatic position filling hiring spree with   
focus on positions needed to go public/SPAC and a Square executive joins board of PSTH, These   
are the only two points that I believe hold any interesting merit at all. 

6. Seth Klarman has a large position in the company. This is great. It has nothing to do with stripe.   
The entire tontine warrant structure absolutely reeks of value due to it incentivizing holding   
through merger in order to claim warrant fractionals. Seth Klarman is a value investor. This is the   
only deduction you and honestly, and reasonably make.

7. Guuggenheim has millions of shares, as well as the ontario pension board. Now why would these   
two buy? First of all, you can't make any reasonable attributions to stripe, there are no links.   
Guuggenheim holds most of these shares in their  Guggenheim Fds Tr-Guggenheim Total Return   
Bond Fund. A BOND FUND. Why? Because these SPAC shares almost act like a zero coupon bond,   
the same reason the pension board likely owns them. If worse comes to worse, they can redeem   
their shares for 20 dollars at merger date, but most likely higher than that the way spacs   
perform.  

8. Warren Buffet slashed his JPM and has an undisclosed stake. There is also a large portion of   
undisclosed PSTH. We don't know the size of Warren's missing investment. We also know this is   
not really up his alley, so if these are linked it's an investment by Ted or Todd. The missing shares   
could be more than a single holder as well. 

9. In recent days stonk go up. What does this have to do with stripe?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR- Bill Ackman followed some stripe people on twitter so apparently PSTH his going to be acquiring a portion of stripe. Please convince me otherwise, because I would love to invest in Stripe.

Tuck it in boys, I know the sight of such a long thick green candle like that excites you, but hold on, **there's more.**

Well 'bout an hour ago [The Wall Street Bet  Journal published a piece](https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-makes-mac-commitment-opening-door-to-apple-developers-11606798804#:~:text=Under%20the%20agreement%20disclosed%20Monday,own%20versions%20of%20the%20machines) about how AMZN was going to be buying AAPL Macs or something like that. Cloud computing nerd shit. idk. I think this means Bezos is about to get in bed with Tim Apple and buy some Macs. And by some I mean buy some warehouses full of Macs.

There's an alternative piece by Seeking Betas, in case you're a peasant that can't afford Wall Street Journal's subscription (everyone should be rich af from PLTR calls). You can google it yourself bc I can't post it.

But waittttt, AAPL will probably gap up since with that fat volume eod and that article that was posted at like 12AM EST. Well first of all, there's probably some insider trading shit right there. Fuck them for not tell us. Secondly, you're right. AAPL will probably get bigly erectly and gape up when the market opens. Fuck that means we can't profit from this right? Who do you think I am... some random that was dared to do this DD for nothing?

TL;DR[http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=54892](http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=54892)

I think TSM make's AAPL's chips . Specifically the M1 that Bezos will stick in his system.

Apex Technologies (soon to be reverse merged with AvePoint) could potentially be one of the most undervalued plays on the market.,1606804138,TrumpsStankLips,46,"Alright retards here me out as I give a quick dd on AvePoint/ Apex Technologies and why it could be a potential rocket ship to Mars. I havenâ€™t seen any dd posts recently so consider this a reminder and donâ€™t get caught sleeping. 

For those that havenâ€™t heard, the private company AvePoint and the public SPAC Apex Technologies agreed to a reverse merger last week that will become official by Q1 2021, most likely by the end of January or beginning of February. 

So, what is AvePoint? AvePoint was founded in 2001 and is a partner of Microsoft. They work in management, protection, and storage of data for Microsoft office 365. (I know you retards apparently love data companies like PLTR so this is right up your alley).

AvePoint has strong business relations with Microsoft and has won Microsoft company of the year 5 of a possible 19 times and the Microsoft VP sits on the board of directors for AvePoint. They also have some legitimate leadership with one of their co-founders being the former CFO of Oracle and the other co-founder being the former head of tech investing at Goldman Sachs. 

On top of that their financials are pretty phenomenal as they have no outstanding debt, 250 million in cash reserves, are profitable, and have been growing in revenue steadily YoY. They are projected to grow roughly 40% in revenue by 2022 too, as they are seeing huge upticks in demand as businesses around the globe are continually transitioning to cloud services and moving their businesses online. 

AvePoint will be priced at a $2 billion valuation once the merger is official and they go public.  

For comparison one of their main competitors, Snowflake, is valued at about 90 billion, while having about only twice the current revenue of AvePointâ€™s. 

Hypothetically, if AvePoint were to become half the value of Snowflake based on revenues, it would be worth more than 20x what it will be at the time it goes public. 

Not saying itâ€™s going to become worth 45 billion but we could see it balloon to 20 billion+ easily, which would still be about 15x what it is now. 

Lastly, they currently do not have calls but as the merger date gets closer, options will be added so you idiots can blow up your accounts on FDs. 

TL;DR Buy apex Technologies and be prepared for the rocket ride.

The cash on hand, huge financial performance and it's niche make this a great play that might turn into a Chinese MEME stock. I have purchased shares and might buy some leaps. This is my favorite of the F stocks. Selling puts, buying shares and might purchase more options. Balance sheet and growth are phenomenal.

FOUR- Shift four payments is an american payment processor that has had some hiccups due to covid. as you can see, even during Covid they have managed to narrow losses. Q3 is a turn around as compared to Q2 and they are beginning to land big contracts such as contracts with the NFL and other large companies. I am selling puts. This thing could be a great growth story as well as a great acquisition target. Recently sold off after hours due to convertible notes that were issued. might be a good opportunity to buy. this is my second Favorite.

FUBO- many of you have seen this ticker. This is a digital streaming television service that focuses on sports. This has seen significant growth and it is projected to tripe sales in the next 3 years. Currently a stock with great growth, a niche market and might be a likely acquisition target. Also, the name is meme worthy and the market cap is 1.8B. Growth is exceptional. This is really a growth play as the financials look terrible. See article. growth is \~60% and average revenue per customer is up 15%.

FROG- A  software play that allows large companies to manage large scale software rollouts and version control. I don't understand all the technical details but it had an epic ipo and has cooled off. growth is exceptional, it's expensive but could be a very promising play. growing \~50% yoy. market cap is 6.4B so it is really trading at a premium as people expect it will continue to grow due to the large TAM. This year it appears it will grow about 40% and ideally the recent ipo will increase growth rates.

Beat the Shorters? Puts on GME,1606807674,ivanttohelp,18,"Whatâ€™s up brothers,

Like many of you, I bought GME close to the top ($18.00). But Iâ€™m convinced this baby is mooning and I want more shares - I just want a better price.

So Iâ€™m thinking to just sell $16.50 puts. If if gets filled, sweet - I get GME at a discount and I get my premium. If it doesnâ€™t fill, I keep the premium anyways and make some money.

Someone tell me Iâ€™m wrong.

Iâ€™m small time, Iâ€™m trading a handful of contracts and only have 120 shares at the moment, so I wonâ€™t fuck over our diamond-handed brothers.

1) Buy RIOT $9.50c for 12/18. Watch out for $9.50-9.70 region as it might pull back. Be prepared to sell ur calls once the stock reaches somewhere near that price. Once it pulls back, watch for $7.50 as it acts as support. Buy the dip. Thatâ€™s short term. 

2) Buy RIOT $15c 1/22/22, buy more calls each time bitccoin takes a 20% dip, sell around September when then bull cycle is expected to end. Thatâ€™s more long term.

On higher than average volume.

â–¶ What does it mean?

ðŸš€ Bulls are winning

ðŸš€ Big players aren't selling the shares they loaded up at $10-$13. Bullish

ðŸš€ It's safer to buy in the second half of the trading day; personally, I usually buy in the last 3 hours and again in the last 5 minutes before market close

 If today's red, the closest trendline support + fib extension is at $15.92. Keeping pocket money in the unlikely case it drops that low wouldn't hurt

Weekly highs resistance since the last cycle is at $20.67, after that the sky is the limit.

â–¶ Q3 earnings expectations?

ðŸš€ If their guidance shows a stronger focus on e-commerce rather than brick-and-mortar stores, we'll surely see a pump, as that would kill every GME = Blockbuster shorter's theory. Bullish.

ðŸš€ If they don't mention that and the price dumps, Cohen might step in and increase his stake, finally guiding GME into the 21st century. That would be a major squeeze catalyst. Bullish.

The earnings that matter the most though, are in Q4 (March 2021). They will show what a e-commerce powerhouse GME has become.

That said, I'm personally holding through earnings, hoping for a dump and a takeover by Cohen.Â  ""Worst"" case scenario the price pumps and I can't load up at cheaper prices. 
That's why I'd rather have an amount of shares I'm happy with before earnings.

â–¶ When do I cash out?

Realistically, whenever you're happy with the profits you've made.

ðŸš€ The price peaked around $60s and the mid $50s in the last two console cycles, respectively. Now that GME has a modern business model it can be safely guessed that it can reach at least previous highs

ðŸš€ No one can tell how high the price will be with the squeeze. I can tell you it's gonna be $200 if that makes you wet your pants, but that'd be wishful thinking cause, again, I can't guess how high it will be. $50 is already a good enough PT for me

That said, I'm happy I feel safe holding shares through ER, for once. 

I wish you all the greasiest tendies. Hold to Valhalla ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

thank you for going through this post. You truly are a beautiful person.

Are you ballsies deep in PLTR and felt the itching yesterday? That is called a DIP. It happens often. Some are bigger, some are smaller.

What can you do about it, you ask?

If the price dips, you want to buy more. Because you will have more and the price will go up. So the more you put there, the more we all have. We are all family around here. We support each other. We never do pump and dump, we are mooning stuff around here. We send it flying over there and we watch when the work is finished. This is the way.

TL:DR&gt; Buy the dip.

Ark-Invest Buys $PLTR cyber Monday sale,1606823353,tomoreilly39,4,"Yesterday, at one point, our beloved palantir was in the shitter. Ark-invest saw this as a perfect opportunity to build on their position in the company. They bought approx. 11,000 shares ($300,000) of PLTR. They have also made a statement recently about how they believe institutional investors are â€œwarming upâ€ to palantir.

From Ark: Palantir (PLTR)

Palantir (PLTR) rose 42% this week. Without a specific catalyst, institutional investors seem to be warming up to the stock roughly a week after it announced strong earnings report and a US Army contract for its Gotham software.

CARR Global Carrier,1606823510,Either_Loan_6516,5,"
Recent posts have been right last week on GME and Dollar General now onto the next play. Global Carrier is a HVAC/Refrigerator company. Best in the business. IPO was back in April. Gradual incline over the past few months with no little downward movement. Company has been meeting and exceeding earnings every time. Small divined of payment not a lot but still something. But the real sauce...When Moderna and Pfizer get approval next week from FDA which is going to happen the distribution is going to be complicated. The one company that can handle a majority of this is right here. Guarantee the government will back distribution in America and will pay a huge amount for this to happen safety and effectively. Wonâ€™t be a bidding war they will choose the best company and that CARR. Other countries will do the same especially in Europe and this company is world wide. Price target is 45$ or more by December 18th. Why is this important. Options are cheap due to low IV. That is all. Also volume picked up yesterday so good sign?

"How some analysts try to f**k you and why you should always verify their track records- analysing Paul Coster, J.P. Morgan's NKLA analyst",1606826228,nafizzaki,6,"So, the GM MoU with NKLA gets published yesterday and the stock tanks.
This is the last coffin in the nail for NKLA, they are completely done for.

Yet, we hear our lord and savior Paul Coster say this,

{On Wall Street, two analysts who cover Nikola disagreed on what the scaled-down GM agreement means. J.P. Morgan analyst Paul Coster maintains an overweight rating on the stock.

""We think this is a positive outcome for Nikola over the medium to longer term, since the company can now focus on the core Class 8 truck initiative and avoid the distraction and [capital expenditures] associated with the Badger,"" Coster said in an investor note.}-[link.](https://pub.webull.com/us/news-html/3de4184e223f46448f8f09bdf66a2e4e.html?theme=2&amp;_v=1&amp;color=1&amp;hl=en&amp;sp=1&amp;_v=1&amp;theme=2&amp;color=1&amp;hl=en)

In October he said this,
{J.P. Morgan analyst Paul Coster calls it â€œa compelling strategy.â€However, Coster also points out Nikolaâ€™s near-term success hinges on GM signing on the dotted line.â€œWe think the GM partnership deal is the most important near-term catalyst,â€ Coster said. â€œFailure to consummate the GM deal would be a fatal blow for the Badger initiative, but a serious blow to the more important Truck initiative too, in our view. The fuel station partnership announcement is less important, in our view, though a potential validation of the company that could resonate with investors. Pending completion of the five Nikola Tre trucks could be a boost to credibility, obviouslyâ€¦ For now, the GM partnership is a stress-test for the company.â€Coster remains positive on Nikola and keeps an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating along with a bullish $41 price target.}-[link.](http://www.shippipedia.com/nikola-stock-will-surge-70-from-current-levels-says-analyst/)
Did you just read that? He has a price target of $41. 

Again, what he said yesterday kinda completely contradicts with what he said in October.

2 years ago he have had such a [low rating(screenshot of a screenshot)](https://imgur.com/a/kTSmcxW) that I find it surprising that he has almost came to [3 stars.](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/paul-coster)

Of course, he probably has inherent interest to see NKLA go above its current price. For this he doesnâ€™t give a f**k if people buy into his arguments and jump on board on this stock.

I guess he wants just a dead cat bounce so that he could save his ass and make sure that retail investors become the ultimate bagholders of this company.

There are many other analysts like that in the Street and I donâ€™t know how they remain in business for so long. But my main point is that be careful before you jump into a stock. 

Some of you probably just see an average analyst price target, see a stock is undervalued or overvalued and jump to trade it. I mean according to analyst estimates NKLA would be a kind of a good deal in this overvalued market(see PLTR price targets, itâ€™s hilarious). But we all know that this company's stock is ultimately going to $0(probably within next year).

Disclaimer: I am short NKLA, have Dec 11 $20 puts, long PLTR shares(so I have my bias too)."

What I learned from half year of investing (and trading),1606826364,ashish421,74,"Sup retards, I am writing this to share what I learned in my small time of investing and trading till now. Of course there are a lot of retards here who are less retarded than I am, and so know more about investing than I do. This is partly to keep a note to myself (and make it public), so I don't repeat the same mistakes again. And partly to give some pointers to those here who are more retarded than me.

1. This is something you would already know. There are a lot of people here posting 1000+% gains in a few weeks/months. But there are a lot lot more than that who are not making that, and in fact losing. I know you know that as well. So don't fucking get jealous and play stupid gambles (like buying fucking nikola at fucking 79$). You are already a retard, you already have a disadvantage compared to those outside. Don't let your emotions get the better of you as well.
2. Pre-market is fucked up. Never buy a gamble stock just by seeing high pre-market rise. You will almost always lose. 
3. You're new to WSB, you are seeing people posting a lot of tickers that are going to be the next NIO or the next PLUG. Don't go buying all those ticker. When someone posts a DD, don't just scroll down and comment 'All I read was buy' and buy the stock. Do your own DD.
4. (This may not apply to all) Try to limit the number of stocks you're holding to a minimum. Diversification is good but make sure you're not going overboard (like having only 2000$ to invest/trade and buying 40 tickers with that). Even if all those 40 stocks are hot growth stocks, you're not gonna make a lot of money because a lot of them WILL go down. Buy the stocks in which you feel confident that they will go up in some time. Don't buy something just because it has been going up a lot and everyone is saying it'll go up.
5.  Hold what you've bought for some time if you believe in the stocks short term/ long term capability. Don't sell it as soon as you're down some 5-10%. If you do that you'll just be buying high selling low all the stocks. As a personal example: I really believe in Unity's business and capability. I bought unity at 95, but got scared when it fell down to 86, then, as soon as it hit 95 again I sold. I was stupid, Now unity is 150. Believe in yourself more than some random retards on WSB.
6. I have made more money when hyped stock fall, compared to when hyped stocks rise. Invest in what seems safer (and can give good returns as well). For ex. when pfizer vaccine news came out, Shopify and Zoom fell like crazy. Even though I feel Zoom stock valuation is sooooo fucking stupid, I bought the dip and sold both the stocks just yesterday for about 20-30% gains on both. - This is really subjective, but I like this more compared to investing in PLTR at 30 or NIO at 50 (By the way I have positions in both of them and am about 100% up on both, so PLTR, NIO to moon). Remember that losses are also big in high growth stocks just like gains.
7. Keep a fucking target of how much return youre looking for. Dont get distracted by posts every day on WSB posting their 1000+% returns. You need 25-30% return a year to get rich eventually (this is just my personal target). Have a separate account for trading where you've trying to get crazy gains (and actually getting crazy losses), and keep the amount in that account minimum.

I know all this is just a repeat and my post may just get removed. Who cares.

Finally, even though everyone in WSB is a retarded autist and they just jack off to their gains and other's losses. I've learned a lot from posts in this sub. And this is also a really good sub for discovering stocks to do DD on. Many other positives of WSB, just not mentioning them here.

Happy trading/investing."

ABT- Abbott laboratories- easy money,1606827147,jeb17,8,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT) DD


Abbott Laboratories is easy money. They make 5 minute covid testing strips, and have a government contract. Back in August they announced a $750 million contract with US government.
https://www.biospace.com/article/abbott-wins-750-million-contract-with-u-s-government-for-rapid-covid-19-test-/

With Biden in office, he wants to make testing more available and free to everyone, thats where Abbott comes in. They already have a government contract, and so things are only looking up for ABT. They had a low of $62 stock price on the year and it is currently $108 and climbing. Im not taking this as a yolo with weekly calls, Im going long because I am a pussy and going long with Jan 20, 2023 120 calls. They are sitting around $12 a call now and no way the stock doesn't go up in the next two years. Its free money. 

You might ask oh there is a vaccine coming, that will stop testing. Wrong. Not everyone is going to rush out and get the vaccine, and even if they do, schools, government etc will still make testing necessary and take precautions to make sure they aren't spreading covid. 

Thats not all, they are also helping out with diabetes among many other things, so the future of the company is bright.

[Black Friday Play] Get in on $NKE ASAP,1606827469,WallStreetDarling420,14,"Black Friday and Cyber Monday are breaking records like never before. Bored ass middle class motherfuckers are sat at home with jackshit to do and cash to spare. So they're splurging on online shopping.

Enter Nike. 

Nike has been making all kinds of moves lately. They're not just a sportswear company anymore. Like Lululemon, they broke on through to the other side. They are a lifestyle brand. They are stay-at-home comfort. They are a socially progressive, culturally relevant, and swaggy af.

Above all though, they have the best online shopping experience out of all their peers. My family browsed Adidas, Puma, Reebok, New Balance, and Nike for hours yesterday. We ended dropping thousands on Nike. 0 on everyone else. Adidas, likely the competitor-in-chief, has probably the worst e-commerce interface of the lot.

So buy Nike. That is all. Earnings on 12/18 will be a blowout.

I will quit my fucking job and prove it I swear to god

Corsair Going Up More... A lot More,1606829771,keenanodonnell1,13,"New computer parts like Graphics cards and CPUâ€™s are selling out immediately and selling for a lot higher than their retail price on the secondary market. This is something the Gaming PC space has not seen at this level before and it shows just how high the demand is for gaming PCâ€™s right now. Stocks like AMD and Nvidia might seem like the best stocks to buy because itâ€™s their parts that are selling out selling out. However they are such big companies and we wont see their prices go to the moon. While I do recommend buying AMD because of their recent leaps in CPU dominance over intel, their new  gaming GPU (6900XT) that is faster than Nvidia for the first time in years (and for 2/3 the price no less) and the fact that they make the Silicon for both the PS5 and new Xbox. I would not expect AMD to moon just became of Christmas Sales, itâ€™s more of a long term play. However With this new spotlight on the PC gaming market, Corsair should see a massive increase in revenue. If you know anything about PC gaming you know the name Corsair. I for one own multiple Corsair products and am very happy with them, which is why I bought Corsair at IPO a few months ago. All kids want this year is Consoles and Gaming PCâ€™s and even professionals have started investing more money into the PC space because they are on their computers all day due to the pandemic. All this crazy demand around the PC space 100% helps Corsair. They are a huge player in the PC market and they make everything from custom water cooling parts for PC enthusiasts to headsets for console gamers. Corsair also owns El Gato. El Gato makes products such as screen capture cards and webcams, things that have seen a huge increase in sales during the pandemic due to their usefulness in online meetings. All this combined makes Corsair a necessary stock to own this Christmas Season."

Corsair Price Upgraded by Multiple Analysts. This may be the beginning of an upward bullish trend for CRSR.,1606829879,justcuddle,36,"The sharp decline of the stock price was nothing more than profit taking. The company itself, Corsair Gaming, continues to be a leader in the Gaming industry with ""The new guidance implies revenue growth of 50%-52% compared to last year"". Corsair is profitable year after year even beating the first estimated earnings by 0.25, which is more than double the expected.

""Corsairâ€™s CEO Andy Paul stated, â€œIn our Gaming and Creator segment, we continue to see strong sales in all price points, which we believe indicates that we have both new customers buying gear as well as existing customers refreshing and upgrading"".

But with the increasing popularity of streaming and quarantine, ""The highest growth continues to be in our streaming products, as gamers want to share video content with their friends and fans"". 

The positive outlook of this company continues to be a great short term AND long term hold.

&gt;In reaction to the upbeat guidance, Wedbush analyst [Michael Pachter](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/michael-pachter) raised the price target to $49 from $34 and reiterated a Buy rating on Corsair. In a research note to investors, Pachter opined, â€œThe pandemic has expanded growth well beyond the normal level, but as growth has largely been driven by new gamers and streamers entering the market, this has widened Corsairâ€™s user-base for the long-term, in our view.â€

$SUMO is going to the moon following Dec 7 earnings,1606830413,willydidwhat,39,"ok Autists

Not really a public markets guy, but I spend a ton of time in private enterprise tech.  Lately I've been deep in log management/SIEM (exciting fucking stuff) and have unearthed a big upside opportunity.  I've already placed my bets so now I'm sharing with you retards so you can pump my numbers.

tl;dr, $SUMO is about to drastically beat expectations on late released q3 earnings because the market appears to have conflated their go forward (rev growth) performance with their deepest doldrum q2 performance.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Sumo's earnings timing has depressed value.  While almost all other enterprise sales tech have benefited from the release of their Q3 results, Sumo closes quarters a month off. We still haven't seen Sumo's Q3 and their Q3 earnings call is Dec 7
2. The market was unimpressed by Sumo at IPO because they had really slow growth in Q2, 30%.  However, lots of enterprise sales cycles were delayed in that period.  In that slow quarter, nearly 100% of that growth came from existing customers with almost no net new customers ([Meritech breaks this down](https://www.meritechcapital.com/blog/sumo-logic-ipo-s-1-breakdown)).  Their growth rate in Q1 and the year before was about 50%  I expect they will return to this growth rate in Q3
3. This all amounts to equity pricing that is wrong two ways: Revenue estimates are off and price multiples are off, all  due to an incorrect expected growth rate in Q3 and forward.  I could probably try to guess how far off they are and set a price target since YoY growth is close to 50% and rev multiple should be closer to 15x+, but nobody's paying me for this, and I just need my tendies to print.

* He went to Stanford Law School and called it a ""glorified trade school"".
* He moved to Berlin, taught himself German, and wanted to retire with $250k tendies to pursue various ""forms of debauchery"".
* He got a PhD in fucking philosophy at a German university, something that Karp even admits himself is totally unemployable and useless, just like you.
* He went on after to 'start a business' pumping meme stocks himself and developed a reputation for it.
* He practices tai chi and qigong in public with a real sword. Motherfuckers, he literally studied the blade.

Hey everyone and Welcome! So, letâ€™s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/2g68hFq) finish about flat for the day, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/cr8CXVz) finished about half a percent down for the day and the [DOW INDUSTRIAL](https://ibb.co/9tFCX3j) was the biggest losers down almost 1% thought all 3 of them were down even bigger intraday. So, both the SP and the DOW finished with record monthly gains, the SP finish up 10,9% for the month above the previous record of 10,2% exactly 40 years ago, while the DOW finished up 11,9% and topped the previous record from 1987 with the Nasdaq also having its best month since the middle of the dot-com boom in 2001. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/4g07SHm) also finished down more than 1% for the day though at one point it almost hit the 23 mark.

Almost 70% of companies were declining yesterday on above average volume, as I believe investors were taking profits after the big gains from this huge November rally that we had. [CHART](https://ibb.co/0XvY72g)

Energy was the biggest loser yesterday as the whole [sectors](https://ibb.co/JBTt3Bt) finished down more than 5% while the only 2 sectors in the green were Technology and Health Care as we saw [value plays](https://ibb.co/SBGP6jS) struggling through the day while large cap growth companies were gaining, led by Apple as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/xf7mqtc), which finished the day up over 2% while the whole financial and energy sectors were down big.

Here are the biggest economic [data](https://ibb.co/yV5rQ23) that we are expecting today, as we will see numbers from the MARKIT PMI and the ISM INDEX with vehicle sales arriving later in the day. Also only one big company is expected to report earnings today, [Salesforce](https://ibb.co/YTK19Tr), which is also expected to close a deal today to buy Slack in a cash-only deal. Salesforce is expected to maintain its EPS flat year over year with revenues increasing by more than 16%. I fully expect this to be beaten as this company has gone under appreciated in my opinion as smaller cloud companies have seen the bulk of the stock market gains. If they manage to buy Slack that will be a very positive thing for the companyâ€™s future as they will move on to bring a new challenge to the Microsoft bundle. [SLACK NEWS](https://ibb.co/GRjM1wk)

Great news came in the early morning today, as the OECD [revised](https://ibb.co/mc2dhhd) itâ€™s GDP contraction up 0,3% with a real GDP growth forecasted at over 4% next year and 3,7% in 2022 as China is expected to account for one-third of the world economic growth next year, it might be the time to get more into that part of the stock market as they are expected to have a GDP growth of 8% next year.

Also, despite dropping more than 3% yesterday, Tesla saw itâ€™s shares bounce back after the [news](https://ibb.co/hdMz1px) that it will be added at full float-adjusted market cap all at once on Dec. 21 due to its ability to accommodate big trades. With other good news coming yesterday also as China finally [approved](https://ibb.co/6n8hzP7) the selling of the Model Y in the country.

Also relating to the EV world, NIO just [announced](https://ibb.co/m91nYNp) while writing this post an increase of over 100% in delivery numbers for November to over 5 thousand cars. As they company keeps it over 100% year over year deliveries increase and are expected to continue the accelerations of production capacity to accommodate the bigger order numbers.

While the hydrogen power Nikola seen itâ€™s share drop yesterday after a worse than expected [deal](https://ibb.co/1nQ2bb5) with GM, as GM has pulled back from its initial far bigger commitment with Nikola as the 2 companies signed a non-binding memorandum that expires at the end of next year, so things may get even worse for Nikola as they also scrapped plans to build the Nikola Badger electric pickup and will refund order deposits for the truck. This resulted in an over 25% drop in Nikola [shares](https://ibb.co/ZMMj5rY) and I expect this to go even lower, as the former CEO Milton will see about 130 million shares unlocked today and a total unlock of 161 million shares, that is more than the [current free float](https://ibb.co/z8vzVTj) shares available for the company at 117 million. If he decides to sell those, that will crush the stockâ€¦ So, I think a 15-16 $ price in the near future is possible even with Milton selling his shares.

Good news for 2 of the biggest 3 companies in the world Apple and Amazon [announced](https://ibb.co/RCwxB2s) that they will team up to offer new cloud computing services for AWS users to be able to create and test apps remotely. This will be a big positive for both companies as Amazon will benefit from more cloud services usage while Apple continues to expand the software and services business.

Other great news came for retailers as Shopify [announced](https://ibb.co/KLD25BH) that sales were up 75% year over year as the Black Friday to Cyber Monday sales are booming, this bolds well for companies like Loweâ€™s, Home Depot, Amazon and many others.

While on the vaccine front, Modernaâ€™s candidate is [expected](https://ibb.co/HB8fdnm) to be review in mid-December. I believe the stock has gone way over itâ€™s head and has passed big players in the pharma industry like Vertex and Regeneron though for Moderna this will be theyâ€™re first product to be released to the market, I think this stock is well over-hyped at this price, I donâ€™t believe itâ€™s worth more than 100$ in the long-run as more vaccines will become available with far cheaper prices.

The only big company that reported earnings yesterday was [ZOOM](https://ibb.co/FB33wzw) as they beat expectations by [23 cents](https://ibb.co/GJXzrxj). The stock did fall more than 5% in after-hours trading as I expected as the total number of paying customers was only up 17% quarter over quarter with far bigger increases in free users that created bigger bills and drove the profit margins lower to 66% way below the 72% analysts expected. I believe the company faces a though 2021 year as they will have very difficult comps to take on, but I believe this will remain a winner in the longer run. So I sold out of my position on Zoom before this earnings but I will keep an eye on them, if the price drops below 400$ I would be willing to buy the stock once again.

Meanwhile Biden has announced [his top picks](https://ibb.co/8XrnvpQ) for economic appointments and nominations and I believe this are very friendly picks for the stock market as he has gone with more central liberal picks and hasnâ€™t gone to far to the left.

So I still believe the stock market is in a bull run for the moment with lot of great catalysts like the [PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION](https://ibb.co/T26q9Fz) being more and more certain, and a very likely split government after the Georgia Senate runoff election. So, with at least 2 vaccines right around the corner and treatments for the illness also getting better by the day, this will lead to a gradual reopening of the economy as less and less industries will suffer and the whole economy will eventually go back to normal. Also, the end of the US-China trade war might be in sight or at least a reduction in the trade tensions between the two biggest economies as Biden is close to taking over the Presidency in the US.

I dont have very much to invest but putting Â£150 a month split into all these with Â£300 so far and im changing the percentages of the markets investment value based on opening performance for the day then set to auto reinvest any earnings back into the pie.

Its estimating 1.52mil after 28.8k investment over 16 years taking into account the past 5 years of performance and estimating it from that. Im averaging 0.60% a day on all these. 

Is there anything i can do to get the ball rolling a bit quicker or is this a good strategy?

I dont know what im doing by the way! complete noobtard. ðŸ˜” just dont want my son living my slave life living paycheck to paycheck no savings and a shit retirement at god knows what age.

I was in 8k of debt my mother happily left me in as soon as i turned old enough (18) to take out catalogue loans without my knowledge so making my lifetime work harder for an easier one for him takes priority regardless of where i end up i couldnt give a shit about anything for myself and not bothered if i end up a homeless cripple as long as the results were worth it for him in the end.

Why is Aphria so overlooked ? just bought in holding for 2 or 3 months expecting 2-5 bagger.,1606833698,Blastr0,11," As many might know, Aphria is a $WEED stock. actually one of the biggest one in existence right now.

In my opinion its worth over 10b or at least more than canopy growth. They also just secured a deal buying SweetWater Brewing company to improve their Line of products which will help with future revenue and profit.

* Ticker is BYDDF or BYDDY (Robinhood) - !not BYD in the US!
* Strong battery/EV producer in China. Their Blade Battery is one of a kind special.
* It isn't listed on US exchanges, so there is a $50 commission fee. More upside to be had though.

$MU at ATH of 20 years. Reminder of The Rise and Fall of MartyMoho,1606834457,pacosteles,9,"I reproduce https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eaujdv/the_rise_and_fall_of_martymoho/

/u/MartyMoho

is one of the true original gamblers of WallStreetBets.

The Legend of MartyMoho begins on March 23rd, 2017 when he posted a $1,000,000 position in Micron (MU). This was roughly 55% shares at a $26 price average, and 45% calls split between ITM and OTM.

Micron held an earnings report later that day and the results were much better than expected. Micron delivered, skyrocketing afterhours over 10%. Marty woke up the next morning up over $600,000.

What made this even more impressive is that Marty was not some ultra-rich billionaire with a highly diversified portfolio of assets. No. Micron was the only company he owned, and this was his entire portfolio.

â€œAh, well, I've only owned $MU or its derivatives for almost two years. I swing traded $AMD a little fall of 2016 but essentially that's all $MUâ€

Marty continued to hold positions in Micron over the next year, and his account reached a peak value of $2,500,000 from his original $200,000 in September 2015. A 1200% gain.

Marty wasnâ€™t finished though, the money, the shitposting, the endless call outs of Jim Cramer on twitter (@MartyMoho) wasnâ€™t enough for him and in true wallstreetbets fashion, he needed more.

On March 22nd, 2018 Marty bet all $2,300,000 on $MU calls set to expire over the course of the next several months, a majority being OTM. $MU was trading at $54 that day, and his strikes were all between $50-$80.

Marty remained optimistic as $MU hovered around the same price over the next several months. But on August 30th, 2018 Marty started losing hope. On this day he made his final ever comment on reddit:

â€œI don't know, I expected at least a partial run-up but it's not materializing at all. If it doesn't pop after ER like it did this time last year, I'm pretty f'dâ€

$MU was trading at $53 when he made that comment, theta was killing him. But it didnâ€™t get any better for Marty. $MU fell 40% over the next few months, all the way to $30 as his calls were expiring. $2.3 million lost, as the strikes were so far out of the money that even if he had sold, it would have been too late. They were worthless.

That was the last comment Marty ever made online, his Reddit, Twitter, and Stocktwits all stopped being active between August 30th and 31st, 2018. No one knows for sure what happened to him, but the speculation remains. One thing is for certain though. As quickly as he rose, he fell, and the legend of Marty is now just that â€“ a legend."

Dynatrace ($DT): the next big DevOps stock,1606834728,PingPongPlaya17,7,"**What does Dynatrace do?**

Dynatrace provides cloud-based, AI-driven observability. For us retards, that means they do big software shit that sounds cool.

**Why invest in DT?**

DT is like the Tesla of observability; they started out by targeting a niche market of high end customers. They primarily look at 1B+ revenue customers, and they've got an ARR of ~230k for ~2500 of those. Thing is, the number of 1B+ rev companies that are within DT's target demographic is more like 15k, so they're only 17% penetrated right now.

**Little Competition**
The other big player in the space
 is New Relic, but they're focused on much smaller businesses. Cisco is another competitor but they're laughably smaller. DT currently has ~70% of the F500 on its platforms. 

**Expectations**

The average price target for DT is $49 and the high is $59, so there's plenty of room to get some sweet tendies here. COVID has only sped things up because companies have to transition to the cloud and DT offers both legacy and cloud solutions. DT is also pretty undervalued relative to its peers in the DevOps space with a multiple of 19. We all know DevOps is the next major tech subsector and DT looks like it'll be leading the charge in the observability space.

BCRX: What a real infinity squeeze looks like... Charts included like an autist.,1606836807,DerpyMcOptions,9,"So I posted up my DD on this little company back \~ 6 months ago, and believe a short squeeze would happen if tutes decided this was a company worth a shit once again.  Looks like my posts worked they did their DD and piled the F into this company....  The shorts are now fuk'd and here's what it looks like now (bottom vs when I first posted.)   The bad news for the shorts here is the company will be PRing \~ 3 times this week, wed thurs and friday.  

They already made this info available to the public in weeks prior, shorts are betting it's bad news but the company has pre announced them to all occur 1 day before their new drug launch... during FDA approval and 1 day after FDA approval. (does this sound familiar?  This is what happened with VW 3 PR's set the stock price into infinity at shorts cost.) 

Now why this matters: Shorts are out of their league, period.  The price stayed too low and made it too easy to accumulate a severely undervalued company.

The stage: Of the trading shares on the market (57 million) 37 million are on loan from shorts which surpass the 100% float mark and badly.  If all of the open market decided to trade their shares to the shorts (\~ 17 million) the shorts would still have 20 million shares to make up the difference.  This means hedge funds and big institutions can name their own price, this is the literally the same stage setup that caused VW's massive infinity squeeze to become the most valuable company in the world for a few days.

[TL;RD? Get in BCRX NOW and name your own sell price as we go to infinity b\/c short's overextended to hell and have become fuk'd.](https://preview.redd.it/nv65vxt9fl261.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7812ecdf64131f1ced095c18017e426f614e7fb7)"

Freetrade literally took me a few minutes to set up and deposit Â£100 (gotta test before YOLO-ing my Christmas bonus). Already bought into PLTR, NIO and the other meme stocks you autists seem to recommend (after doing some reading).

I think VALE is the next meme stock because (1): VALE has the largest supply of materials used to make electric batteries and (2) the market for EV's is starting to become oversaturated. People haven't even taken into account the main name brand automakers that are adding more EV's to their fleet or converting current vehicles. So while there is only room for a specific amount of players and their is a ""cap"" on the market, as most Americans only one one vehicle, the inherent value of materials and batteries are unlimited, as every EV will need them.

Long story short, why gamble on specific EV names when there will only be a few winners? The true winner will be the supply chain that has a death grip on those industries.

Least Crooked Brokerage to use?,1606838362,TheApricotCavalier,0,"I have a question for the insiders among us, what brokerage should we use? Its no secret that Wall St. has 'technical difficulties' everytime it looks like they will lose bigly, I'm wondering where to go with the least exposure. Perhaps an international broker? I only hear US based firms recommended, but if your gonna trade US I think it'd be safer to have your advocate elsewhere.

VALE is the next EV Hype Train,1606838835,natelifts,34,"In my opinion, the days of the 10% pumps every day for EV stocks are over, for now, and have entered a period of consolidation. VALE, however, has been solidly rising every single day.

I think VALE is the next meme stock because (1): VALE has the largest supply of materials used to make electric batteries and (2) the market for EV's is starting to become oversaturated. People haven't even taken into account the main name brand automakers that are adding more EV's to their fleet or converting current vehicles. So while there is only room for a specific amount of players and their is a ""cap"" on the market, as most Americans only own one vehicle, the inherent value of materials and batteries are unlimited, as every EV will need them.

Long story short, why gamble on specific EV names when there will only be a few winners? The true winners will be the supply chain that has a death grip on those industries regardless if it's Tesla, NIO, Toyota, GM, or Xpeng. At end of the day, the winner will be TSLA and the automakers people are already familiar with: Toyota, Honda, Ford, GM, etc. Not some obscure name like SOLO that operates out of a mall kiosk.

"Some analysts are trying to f**k you, here's a short analysis of how J.P. Morgan's NKLA and how he is f**king you",1606839580,nafizzaki,2,"So, the GM MoU with NKLA gets published yesterday and the stock tanks.
This is the last coffin in the nail for NKLA, they are completely done for.

Yet, we hear our lord and savior Paul Coster say this,

{On Wall Street, two analysts who cover Nikola disagreed on what the scaled-down GM agreement means. J.P. Morgan analyst Paul Coster maintains an overweight rating on the stock.

""We think this is a positive outcome for Nikola over the medium to longer term, since the company can now focus on the core Class 8 truck initiative and avoid the distraction and [capital expenditures] associated with the Badger,"" Coster said in an investor note.}-[link.](https://pub.webull.com/us/news-html/3de4184e223f46448f8f09bdf66a2e4e.html?theme=2&amp;_v=1&amp;color=1&amp;hl=en&amp;sp=1&amp;_v=1&amp;theme=2&amp;color=1&amp;hl=en)

In October he said this,
{J.P. Morgan analyst Paul Coster calls it â€œa compelling strategy.â€However, Coster also points out Nikolaâ€™s near-term success hinges on GM signing on the dotted line.â€œWe think the GM partnership deal is the most important near-term catalyst,â€ Coster said. â€œFailure to consummate the GM deal would be a fatal blow for the Badger initiative, but a serious blow to the more important Truck initiative too, in our view. The fuel station partnership announcement is less important, in our view, though a potential validation of the company that could resonate with investors. Pending completion of the five Nikola Tre trucks could be a boost to credibility, obviouslyâ€¦ For now, the GM partnership is a stress-test for the company.â€Coster remains positive on Nikola and keeps an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating along with a bullish $41 price target.}-[link.](http://www.shippipedia.com/nikola-stock-will-surge-70-from-current-levels-says-analyst/)
Did you just read that? He has a price target of $41. 

Again, what he said yesterday kinda completely contradicts with what he said in October.

2 years ago he have had such a [low rating(screenshot of a screenshot)](https://imgur.com/a/kTSmcxW) that I find it surprising that he has almost come to [3 stars.](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/paul-coster)

Of course, he probably has inherent interest to see NKLA go above its current price. For this he doesnâ€™t give a f**k if people buy into his arguments and jump on board on this stock.

I guess he wants just a dead cat bounce so that he could save his ass and make sure that retail investors become the ultimate bagholders of this company.

There are many other analysts like that in the Street and I donâ€™t know how they remain in business for so long. But my main point is that be careful before you jump into a stock. 

Some of you probably just see an average analyst price target, see a stock is undervalued or overvalued and jump to trade it. I mean according to analyst estimates NKLA would be a kind of a good deal in this overvalued market(see PLTR price targets, itâ€™s hilarious). But we all know that this company's stock is ultimately going to $0(probably within next year).

Disclaimer: I have NKLA Dec 11 $20 puts, long PLTR shares(so I have my bias too)."
