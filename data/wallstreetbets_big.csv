"3k - 170k since March (Also, buy LIT!!)",1609459326,Wolzok,20,"https://preview.redd.it/jwfh65wgyf861.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fec2a8fb0c083b2924e6ab56ebfc8145208bc61b

Ethos:

Why am I worthy enough to share my story here amongst so many hero's and zero's? Because I'm a person, and my experience, my choices, and perception of the world, has value. Because I've thought about stocks every day this year. I've checked Robinhood an average of 7 days a week this year. I've read r/wallstreetbets everyday this year for over an hour, with very occasional deviations to the other r/ finance subs r/theatagang, r/options, investopedia, youtube's kamikaze cash. Autistic? I still don't really understand what autism is, even though I've tried to wrap my head around it, and read plenty about it. The new normal is being an anti social weirdo with a mask on. So I really can't say if i'm on the spectrum or not. 

My game's better than some, worse than others, and you can too.

Origins:

A friend told me about Robinhood in 2016. I'm customer # 994k. I was instantly hooked. I used my pay check money to buy up 1500 AMD, 500 SQ, 50 UI, 50 Tesla, ATVI, NVDA. But I wussed out one day and sold every thing to pay off a credit card in late 2017. Brutal!! 2018 and 2019 I slogged through, carrying on with my life long carpentry journey, (A trade that has been my compass from age 20 until today at 34.) unable to save or pay off anything but minimums even at $40 an hour. I was putting everything I earned + maxed out credit cards into my personal house remodel.

It was the dawn of 2020. I was determined to start again. So I dropped 3k into Robinhood with a fresh philosophy and goal.

New rules. Never sell stock. Only buy stock, (with a few exceptions). Don't cash anything out until account is over 100k, (Despite an over 30k cc balance). /Never pull out.

2020 Plays that got me warmed up:

3k worth of nio and vslr stock, turned into 2k worth after the March crash. I wanted to try options. Because of my rule, never sell stock, I borrowed 1k from a friend, and haven't made another deposit since. 1k in visa calls turned to 4k, vslr calls +18k, more vslr + 25k, apple 16k to 32k back to 16k FD 2 day trade, lost 30k on poorly timed nio calls and nkla puts somehow.(Buy longer dated contracts!) Instead of chasing my losses trying to earn it back as fast as i'd lost it, I took a deep breath and entered my current positions.

Current positions:

* 10@ JD $95 1/15/21 Call 4.15
* 10@ AMD $110 4/16/21 Call 3.30
* 100@ ICLN $30 4/16/21 Call .40
* 100@ LIT $55 4/16/21 Call 4.50
* 85@ JD $135 6/18/21 Call 1.62

*Processing img wabexltlyf861...*

Started with 10's of contracts at a time, now i'm at 100's at a time, after i cash out my current positions around March - April, I hope to be buying 1000's at a time. Looking for the currently unhyped gems, far out of the money, 1/2 a year out+ contracts, with some day trading weeklies along the way if inspiration strikes. Planing on maintaining a 50/50 or 75/25 stock/options ratio in the account. Just turned on margin, only 12k available because most of my account is currently unrealized options contracts. Currently using 100% of the margin.

"GME to 420.69, but only if we make it happen. DD inside.",1609459529,stevenconrad,5,"We all know the short volume far exceeds 100% of available shares of GME. A month back, a post revealed WSB holds over 5-6% of TOTAL available shares. When the shorts have to cover, they need available shares to cover. If no one sells, moon shot right? Not exactly. 

On large moves, people will cash out along the way, keeping the price down. The fewer people that sell, the higher the price is forced until the orders are filled. So how do we get it to the moon? Set an order to sell ALL your GME shares (no expiration) at $420.69. Set it and forget it. When Cohen and Co. refuse to sell, and diamond hand endure, there won't be enough shares to cover the shorts. If the majority of the available shares are at $420.69, Melvin Capital will be forced to bow to the autistic strength of WSB.

Happy New Year, let's retire in 2021."

Professional WSB handler here,1609460507,RamblingCanuck,0,"You guys are my favorite dipshits making cash. That being said I want to put a dumb ass PSA out there for those of you can read.

I really work with kids with Autism spectrum disorder for a living, itâ€™s called ABA. It is amazing what it can do for these kids, it can take many of them and after many years, bring them to a level of function that you canâ€™t tell them apart from other people their age. Itâ€™s their only lifeline to a real future. 

This has been a really hard year for families that have kids with autism. COVID has cucked the school system, which through off tons of kids in therapy into chaos mode as routines were destroyed and changed constantly. ASD kids need their hard set routines. Many parents lost jobs and could no longer afford copayments to keep their kids in ABA therapy, leading to regression of gained skills. 

So donâ€™t forget share those sweet tendies this year if you can. Donate to the Autism charity or organization you want to, It makes a big difference. 

This is WSB so I have no choice to gloat about my measly 10 bagger this year, got in 10k shares of MMEDF at .33 in my Roth IRA. Sold some so that I got my money back and can no literally no longer lose money on it. My remaining shares are riding this ðŸš€to the fucking ðŸŒ with no risk.
It ainâ€™t much but itâ€™s green and finger licking good.

Have a happy new year, may your YOLOâ€™s all be strapped to rockets, and go fuck yourselves."

Full text of Xi Jinping's 2021 New Year address,1609461903,fookinlegend3,8,"""Comrades, friends, ladies and gentlemen, greetings to you all! 

The year 2021 is arriving. From China's capital Beijing, I extend my New Year wishes to you all! 

2020 was an extraordinary year. Facing the sudden coronavirus pandemic, we put people and their lives first to interpret the great love among humans. With solidarity and resilience, we wrote the epic of our fight against the pandemic. 

During the days when we addressed the hardships together, we saw the heroic spirit of marching straight to the frontlines, holding posts with tenacity, taking responsibility to get through thick and thin, sacrifices with bravery, and touching moments of helping each other. 

From medical workers to the people's army, from scientific researchers to community workers, from volunteers to those who built the projects, from seniors to youths born after the 1990s and 2000s, numerous people fulfilled their missions at the cost of their lives and protected humanity with sincere love. 

They pooled their drops of strength into tremendous power and built an iron wall to safeguard lives. Many figures marched ahead without hesitation, many relays were accomplished hand in hand, many scenes showed touching moments, all these vividly illustrate the great spirit of fighting against the pandemic.  

Greatness is forged in the ordinary. Heroes come from the people. Every person is remarkable! 

Our sympathy goes to all the unfortunate ones infected with the coronavirus! We salute all the ordinary heroes! 

I am proud of our great motherland and people, as well as the unyielding national spirit. Only in hard times can courage and perseverance be manifested. Only after polishing can a piece of jade be finer. We overcame the impact of the pandemic, and made great achievements in coordinating prevention and control and in economic and social development. 

The 13th Five-Year Plan has been accomplished in full. The 14th Five-Year Plan is being comprehensively formulated. We are accelerating the pace to set up a new pattern for development, and are deeply implementing high-quality development. 

China is the first major economy worldwide to achieve positive growth, and its GDP in 2020 is expected to step up to a new level of 100 trillion yuan. China has seen a good harvest in grain production for 17 years in a row. China has seen breakthroughs in scientific explorations like the Tianwen-1 (Mars mission), Chang'e-5 (lunar probe), and Fendouzhe (deep-sea manned submersible). Construction of the Hainan Free Trade Port is proceeding with vigor. 

We also defeated severe flooding. With the military and civilians heedless of danger and difficulty, and standing in unity, we managed to minimize the damage of the floods. 

I inspected 13 provincial-level regions and was glad to see people carefully implementing coronavirus prevention and control measures, racing against time to resume work and production, and sparing no efforts to advance innovation. 

Everywhere were vibrant scenes of confident, resilient people making the most of every minute. In 2020, China made the historic achievement of establishing a moderately prosperous society in all respects and achieved decisive success in eradicating extreme poverty. 

We launched the final assault on the fortress of entrenched rural poverty, and cracked this ""hardest nut.""

Through 8 years, under the current standard, China has eradicated extreme poverty for the nearly 100 million rural people affected, and all the 832 impoverished counties have shaken off poverty. 

These years, I have visited 14 contiguous areas of dire poverty. The unremitting efforts of the folks and the wholehearted contribution of the poverty-eradication cadres often come to my mind. 

We still need to stay tenacious like a bamboo deeply rooted in the rocks, keep our feet on the ground, and work hard to paint a magnificent picture of rural vitalization, and steadily march ahead towards the goal of common prosperity.   

This year, we celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, among others, and 30 years of the development and opening-up of Pudong in Shanghai.  As I stood on the southern coast as the spring tide surged and on the colorful bank of the Huangpu River, my mind was filled with a myriad of thoughts. 

Pilot trials have become models and leading forces, and explorations to innovate have become leading forces of innovation. The opening-up and reform has created miracles of development. In the future, we should further deepen reform and expand opening-up with greater courage, and create more ""Stories of Spring."" 

We are not alone on the Great Way and the whole world is one family. After a year of hardship, we can understand more than ever the significance of a community with a shared future for mankind. 

I had many phone calls with friends from the international community, both old and new, and attended many ""cloud conferences."" What we discussed most was staying united to combat the pandemic. 

We still have a long way to go in pandemic prevention and control. People from all over the world should join hands and support each other to early dispel the gloom of the pandemic and strive for a better ""Earth home."" 

2021 will see the 100th birthday of the Communist Party of China. Its 100-year journey surges forward with great momentum. Its original aspiration remains even firmer one hundred years later. 

From Shikumen in Shanghai to the South Lake in Jiaxing City, the small red boat (where the first CPC congress concluded) bore the great trust of the people and the hope of the nation. The boat has sailed through turbulent rivers and treacherous shoals, and has voyaged across violent tidal waves, becoming a great ship that navigates China's stable and long-term development. 

The CPC bears its eternal great cause in mind, and the centenary only ushers in the prime of life. We adhere to putting people at the center, stay true to our original aspiration, keep our mission well in mind, break the waves and sail out for our journey ahead, and we will certainly realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. 

At the historic crossroad of the ""Two Centenary Goals,"" the new journey of comprehensively building a modern socialist country is about to start. The road ahead is long; striving is the only way forward. We have strived, broken through brambles and thorns, and crossed ten thousand rivers and thousands of mountains. 

We will continue to strive, march ahead with courage, and create brighter glory! At just this moment, the festive lanterns have been lit, and family members gather for reunion. The New Year is coming. I wish our land to be splendid, our country to be prosperous, and our people to live in peace. I wish you all a harmonious, smooth and auspicious year, full of happiness! 

Thank you!â€"

Every day our beloved stock sinks and our crew becomes smaller and fucking smaller. Many fallen brothers have been lost this week and we must ensure that we do not lose any more blood moving forward into the new year. Today, I spent the entire trading day obsessively dollar cost averaging on my PLTR stock position and figured out an effective strategy on how to effectively limit your downside risk exposure on this stock while it continues to tank. Get the fuck out of your option positions and stick to buying this stonk only until we start to see an actual reversal. If you are not already deep in the fucking hole already, dedicate 30% of your funds to your entry point and as it continues to drop every 20 cents consistently buy more shares. When PLTR rallies on the day chart then sell a portion or half of your position when you break even and wait for it to continue dropping and then continue to dollar cost averaging on your position accordingly. I literally did this shit all day and actually ended the day slightly in the green with the after hours coming through.

Ok so this is bugging me the fuck out. basically this is the 1/15 GME OTM calls for today and on the 2nd to the last column is the % change for the day. now GME swung up and down \~2% throughout the day ending the day with a big dump. 

I watched the price action on my OTM calls all day and noticed that prices did change violently as the stock swung violently. But towards the end of the day when the stock dumped, options price did not change at all. If fact it went up a little.

From my understanding, any far OTM FDs get wrecked if the stock price goes down just a little bit. but this time it went up??? I'm just wondering what could have caused call options starting from 27 all the way to 40 caused the price to go up. I understand it could be like a liquidity issue but then who's buying all these options??? Could it be the institution?? I'm hella confused. If you have any idea please comment below."

ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€JUICY GME DD ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ + Reason behind ICR change,1609464788,0ptimusPrim0,45,"Alright earlier today I wrote an Erotica novel of DD, which was mainly a preface / foreplay to this. The idea was to be able to finish it all in one go, but I ran out of my supply...

All jokes aside, life came up and I thought I could finish it rather soon but that didnâ€™t happen. 

Many of you have an attention span that is longer than you could last in bed, so Iâ€™ll just spill the DD here. I highly encourage you to go back to that post because Iâ€™m trying to coordinate and a make a push for charities, donation ideas, and creating a social media push / trend to not only round up undiagnosed Autists out there, but to also to send batman signals to #TheDogFather Ryan Cohen.


The best â€œnewsâ€ can be slaughtered by poor presentation. I have doubts with Sherman up there, perhaps theyâ€™ll use someone effective. ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸

#DD points: ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

1) GME is making a bigger push to becoming PC oriented, not just games and accessories, but parts as well. 

2) The reason Sherman was able to qualify GME as â€œessential businessâ€ was because of the few PC stuff they had. Then they sold out of that PC stuff in March and after that they were basically open because of PC qualification despite not having any PC items. By switching to â€œtechnologyâ€ category, Sherman would have to qualify them into that. The way he has been able to do so is for 2 reasons. 

A) To ensure that theyâ€™ll stay open in similar lockdowns. This will probably not be mentioned...but the dude did push for his stores to remain open and got backlash for it. Already tarnished a damaged image. 

B) Change business model and get in that Tech Train.


3) OmniChannel experience. 

4) GME has signed contracts with â€œabout 6â€ vendors and providers â€œa couple which were just recently.â€ That number was a ball park # off the top of their mind. These include MSI, NewEgg and so on. 

5) You will be able to outright buy gaming PCs in stores and / or just order any part you may need. Theyâ€™ve ran small trials for these and plan on rolling it out to stores at different times. Unfortunately not every store will have the same experience/ products based on demographic/ size...but they should still be able to order and ship to home or store pick up. 

6) Stores will have dedicated areas for PC experience. Ok letâ€™s be realistic, most stores are the size a studio...so the PC area will be a house for ants. 

But if you check out local GME stores and see empty display areas / locked glass with nothing in it, this is where it is probably going to be dedicated. 

7) Even if you buy $10 card with $5 certificate, youâ€™re not hurting GME. All those cards have been paid for before they got on the wall. Youâ€™re helping money come back, plus the goal is that people will spend more money. 

The goal from my 1st post with push of pro memberships wasnâ€™t to rely on the $15 or $20...and have that as the savior. 

The idea is that with more memberships, you have more leads, and you have people who are more likely to buy products from you. Youâ€™ve now successfully pried someone from going a bigger retailer or online merchant. 

8) Buy memberships for other people. You can also buy memberships for business such as daycare / hospitals etc. At the very least they can have a physical magazine delivered on a monthly basis ($20 version) even if they never choose to use certificates. 

9) Pro Rewards:
#digital gamers benefit hugely. 
Remember those PSN / Steam etc cards, there is 40pts for every dollar spent on those as opposed to 20 pts on everything else.

Why does this matter? Faster points to redeem certificates for yourself or charities already affiliated with GME. 

Every 5k can be redeemed for $5 certificate or donated to charities. 

If you just recently signed up, you got 10K points already, plus welcome $5 coupon. Your 1st official $5 certificate will be available 1st of each month... so you may have up $20 available pretty soon...

10) GME now offers their own CC, which is available to use the same day. They also offer flex pay options from 2 different vendors who allow you to qualify from your phone and make payments ...GME isnâ€™t taking this risk, they get paid from the vendors, customer pays the vendor. 

They also have a rent to own program, with minimum of $120+. 

Final points:

Most customers are buying for other people, that isnâ€™t going to change. So while e-commerce is huge, some Karens will always need to show up to store...

But GME sells â€œused gamesâ€ for nearly same price as new or more expensive than new games. They donâ€™t make this decision, they sign contracts that canâ€™t reduce price on these games until x amount of time...

But GME barely offers any $$$ for my product.

Hi there, they are a business, the most important thing for a business is to be in profit. 

##How long 1 minute is depends on which side of the bathroom door youâ€™re on...

Letâ€™s talk a quick lesson of value vs worth.

Your PSP might be worth $100 to you, but it only has a a value of $5 to GME. Why? Because for every 1 person that comes in looking for a PSP, they have 15 others trying to trade in. After they reach their limit of trade in, wtf are they going to do? Collect every PSP at the price you want them to? So thatâ€™s part of why you get offered low prices.

Thereâ€™s other things involved. They have bills to pay, electricity, rent, wages, medical benefits, legal fees, alarm / security, maintenance on commercial grade AC/ventilation and many more. Oh yea, they also provide people with a safe place to trade in without risking getting robbed, shot, or killed. 

When any business closes, itâ€™s not just those employees who lose their job. The services that that business relies on (mentioned above) now lose a customer and revenue as well. There is less stores for that AC company to send people out to...which means less money for them, which leads to more lost jobs. 

And you know what caused it? That lazy bum who chose the comfort of purchasing from home from an online merchant etc. Thereâ€™s much more to this and this is just the tip of the iceberg when people choose how you do business and shop. Thereâ€™s pros and cons to everything. Iâ€™m not saying never order online, but try to keep a balance. Support your local businesses when you can. 


TL;DR:

ICE changed to Tech because they are changing their ways, and going more PC oriented. Theyâ€™ve signed contracts with vendors and providers. More focus to PC gaming, include actual gaming computers, and parts that can be ordered.

ðŸš€ ðŸš€ðŸš€Bionano Genomic Biotech Going ParabolicðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€,1609465590,rehope,22,"As you know, the Woman of the year Cathie Wood who called Tesla has pointed to Genome stocks ðŸ§¬ as the next tesla. In fact although her ARKQ which has tesla has seen gains, it has overshadowed her ARKG which has her biotech sciencey genomic etf. Year to date that portfolio has made super saiyan gains at 174% at the time of writing this.

Now in her ARKG the number one holding spot weighted at 6.8% is Pacific Bioscience. That stock has gone in 6 months almost 1000% (yes, i wrote that correctly you retards). $3-&gt; $26.

Now there is a company which claims to be able to do the same genomic technology (mapping of genomes, idk too smart for me, go look it up- can break down your DNA to see the profile) more efficiently in cost and accuracy. (BIONANO GENOMICS). If you google Bionano Genomics the last few days has been gaining traction because the stock has risen from ~0.60 to 1-2 dollars and as of market close 4 dollars. The main reason for this gain has been a study released a week ago from a group of nerds at the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium compared PACIFIC BIOSCIENCES and BIONANO absolutely curb stomped them

Vanguard also bought 5.5 million shares. And as you know, these are the stuck up nerds who your wife will marry after divorcing you as well as her boyfriend after you, will marry. These kids are the same kids who top post on r/investing and hate ðŸŒˆ ðŸ» ðŸš€ and tendies. Theyd rather cash out when their penises are limp.

Now if this company gets FDA approval which they are trying to do since they hired a medical director 4 months ago to help them with this process. Dr. Alka Chaubey has helped another company pass FDA APPROVAL BEFORE. Bionano Sciences will go parabolic. And will probably see similar gains to Pacific Bio, while having a smaller market cap.

Why GME MIGHT CONTINUE DROPPING in January and why you should continue ðŸ’Žâœ‹ your shares and roll out Jan/Apr calls,1609467831,YsDivers,70,"Okay so you retards have probably read some posts about how institutions are going to drive the price down hard today to make their 2020 performance look as nice as possible. A lot of you tards theorized that the price could start going up tomorrow because of this but remember, the shorts are watching us

Remember this every time you read any post or comment about GME on this sub

We already know you fucks are paper hands and that a ton of you guys sold after Q3 er in Dec since people genuinely thought the squeeze might happen then but the share price dropped

I predict the shorts might continue dropping the price throughout January because sentiment is so high for that time and cause more people to sell

I'm telling you to fucking hold because we will get those tendies

Now why am I telling you to roll out Jan and Apr calls? Because you guys are still too fucking jumpy on the squeeze date and squeeze duration

Listen the Volkswagen infinity squeeze lasted less than a week because Porsche owned a ridiculous amount of shares by themselves so the price violently went up until Porsche decided to sell

Since GME ownership is spread so thin, people will be selling off at 30, 40, 50, etc at various points up to 300-400 (my peak price target). This means shorts will be able to cover slowly one at a time but also that the squeeze will happen over a period of 3-6 MONTHS like Overstock and Tesla in 2013

If you have Jan or Apr calls, you will almost certainly miss the peak of the squeeze if it even happens before then (unlikely imo)

I HIGHLY suggest selling calls soon and BUYING SHARES to ðŸ’Žâœ‹at least another full year

or rolling out your calls to Jan 2022 expiry whatever strike you want because ideally, you want a buffer of 45 days + 3-6 months between the start of the squeeze and expiry, in order to capture the entire squeeze and not have theta decay eat into your gains

Jan 2022 expiry means you're hoping the catalyst to squeeze is icr conference (Jan), holidays sales report (Jan) (both unlikely imo), Q4 er (March), Board vote (June), Q1 ER (June/July) and Q2 er (Sept/Oct)

Playing Jan or Apr means you're only betting on a few events triggering the squeeze and you won't even get the full thing

It's important to remember that even though Ryan Cohen is able to turn GME around, making software and transforming the company into a digital focused one takes a lot of time especially if the GameStop coders are really bad (which they are, Silicon Valley engineers are many, many magnitudes smarter and faster than typical non tech corporation ones, I've been a software engineer at both types of companies)

Since the transformation will take a long time, the fruits of Cohen labour would only be apparent in a much later er so I HIGHLY recommend shares and just liquidating any calls with &lt; 2022 expiry

August: CHGG calls, made some gains and doubled down, but ended up losing some in September, bought more of my penny stock

September: ðŸŒˆðŸ» again, SPY FDs, penny stock purchase

October: My penny stock begins to print bigly, sold off my gains to prepare for the PLTR ðŸš€ at the end of the month

November: PLTRðŸš€ takes flight, sold all any remaining positions that wasn't PLTR and bought PLTR FDs lol. Got off the flight just before the month ended

December: Secured my tendies, paid off my motorcycle (2020 YZ250X) Hopped back into my penny stock again just in time before it really printed, but I won't be selling those shares any time soon.  Bought into MT and hoping that this steel ðŸš€takes off next year."
Potential investment opportunity,1609468361,mijocol04,3,Currently theres a website called [earth2.io](https://earth2.io) where the final goal is to make a 1:1 scale model of the earth as a video game. Currently the game is in phase one where you buy real life locations within the game for real world money and this will mean that any land you own will be yours in the game to do whatever on. Furthermore the price of land varies from country to country so the USA cost the most at the moment where as countries like Estonia cost very little and these prices will always be fluctuating so why not get involved and spend most of your money in the process. Finally you can get 5% money back if you use my code K7PO7KX4LB when buying plots of land.

Why you need to take mortgage forbearance ASAP,1609469163,jsmerrill95,107,"If you currently have a federally backed mortgage you will be absolutely fucking retarded if you don't take mortgage forbearance!

due to the cares act pasting earlier in 2020 you are able to take forbearance and not have to pay back the missed payments until the end of your loan. 

Think about it, you basically get an interest free loan for 30 God damn years.

Example: My mortgage is $1300 now even if you were a boring ass boomer excited about your 7% annual returns after 30 years you would accumulate $118,751 after the 30 years.

Now if you want to showcase how massive your giant bull balls are you can put that money in PLTR, GME, or TSLA and see real fucking gains."
PBW (Green Energy Sector ETF) and why you should buy long dated calls,1609469172,FreeIcecreamAfterDin,3,"I'm sick and tired of you retards shilling ICLN and TAN when there's a much better option that's being completely ignored and its literally free money. 100% can't go tits up.

*Processing img wj8kbxawsm861...*

So, here's why you should buy PBW over any other green energy ETF. 

1) It has exposure to both solar and EV. A lot of these green energy ETFs are only solar. They completely leave out EV, which is going to be massive. PBW gives you exposure to both parts of the sector, unlike many other ETFs.

2) It has memes and majority of the stocks are small cap. As mentioned, small caps make up 61.91% of the ETF and its got some meme stocks. Biden is going to become president in a month and he is all for green energy. These memes and small caps might see massive growth when Biden starts funding green energy and passing green energy policies. For this reason, I think the ETF may explode and its important to get in before Biden is president. I suspect the green energy sector will have a lot of momentum during Biden's term.

3) Invesco made this ETF. Sound familiar? They made QQQ. I think people will flock to this ETF in the future when everyone wants to jump into green energy, after Biden sets the sector on fire.

I'd suggest buying what I did, the longest dated calls. There is lots of talk about a market crash in the coming months, so you want to have time for PBW to recover if we do crash. I think the green energy sector is going to rally like crazy soon. **It has already gone up 203% in a year though.** You could argue it is overpriced, but I believe this is an emerging sector and has much more room to grow, especially with a president pumping the sector.

"I know nothing, where do I start?",1609472978,mickeejack,31,"I literally don't know a single thing about trading but have always been curious. I want to know about resources, apps, history, anything and everything.

Some background. I am a minimalist, never had any issues managing my money, am experienced and sought after in my trade so I pick my exact days and hours. Currently work 13 hours on Saturdays and Sundays. Super low outgoings, make good money, always have solid savings. Monday-friday off for my hobbies, social life, mental health. Normally I would travel 6 months of the year but with the pandemic I can't so I don't know what to do with my money. 

I have never had debt, moved out of home at 16. Don't understand the way people navigate and spend. I think I could effectively retire on a very small amount of money, am not greedy and already have really nice things. 

So I guess I feel like I am in a great position to at the very least look into trading. Even if I spent 6 months researching but never made a trade I would be happy. Or maybe I yolo all my savings for the Lol's?"

GME with Greeks for the Geeks,1609474941,Furnitureman80085,39,"ETHOS: I've been scalping stocks for four years. From the start, I've planned on making a living from it. YTD I've finished 2020 at 230%. (Only played tesla once and lost on it.) This is my career path and my rent, car, bills, wife, and step child all depend on it.

PATHOS: fuck banks. Fuck them fuck them fuck them fuck them. Anybody who's tried to swim in the market knows that big money controls money. WSB has caught two such banks with their shorts down. Melvin and BOA have their shorts around their ankles on GME. 

LOGOS: The market is not a gentle place. And what's right does not always prevail. My 12/31 16.50 calls turned to equity today and now I hold $20k+ in GME. I'm right, GME gang is right, the people are right and the banks are wrong. 

I'm in this trade because I'm waiting for a squeeze. I don't think the banks are even sweating yet. My $20k and WSB's $20 million aren't enough. 

I need someone to explain to me how WE can flip GameStop. How are we going to hold enough shares that the banks will pay upwards of $100 for them?"

* *The Post of the Year* \- the greatest fucking thing in this sub, for whatever reason
* *The Balls-Deepest Move* \- the most leveraged-to-the-tits, insane, all-in move
* *The ""Get The Fuck Off My Boat"" Award* \- best mic drop/told you so moment
* *The Phoenix Award* \- one who lost bigly and rose from the ashes

* *Yes SEC, This Post Right Here* \- the most questionable or outright illegal dumbass advice 
* *The Dr. Michael James Burry Honorary PhD Award* \- a truly autistic DD that revealed an amazing and accurate play for big gains

GME Squeeze,1609475753,redcedar53,35,"If this GME short squeeze is so â€œwell-knownâ€, I donâ€™t understand why some hedge fund (or a team of) is not buying up 70% of the shares like Porsche did and just not release them. Sure thatâ€™s 635M, and quite a bit of play, but thatâ€™s pretty much a guaranteed $5.7B profit (easier to spread the risk if multiple funds team up). The news will be quite the â€œshockâ€ no one would see it coming and there will be short panic? This just seems like such an easy play for the big boys, no?

The funds donâ€™t necessary have to believe in GME and its future. Just the technical set up and the number of shares shorted. This would be a pure numbers play.

Or do we think this is already happening in the background (hence these large â€œunknownâ€ purchases that weâ€™ve been seeing lately)?

GME.. Lots of FUD.,1609480951,MainlineX,12,"I am long GME 4k shares @13.25 after cost average. I got in after reading some of u/deepvalue? Months ago. I got started at $8 on shares and 10c april. 

I am not looking at my portfolio but I have 10c, 15c, 25c all april. I have averaged up 5 times. 

I am not a smart man. I follow trends and what I believe in. I did the same thing as my guy u /deepvalue. I have been into every gamestop store i can drive to in 5 hours, even down into the morass of the MS delta. The real deal is that what they are doing is working, at least kind of. 

.. same day stuff is fucked because they use door dash and door dash gives first name and last name first letter.   Well I tried that, my name is the 7th most common name in the world, and my last name starts with S... so yea, I got mixed up and fucked, not because if GME but because of $DASH. Turns out that $DASH labels orders by first name, and last initial. Would have worked fine if my name was zack zak. 
I hung out and talked to the manager after going to the store to get my shit straight... he is out if so much store stock., and corporate has no clue when he can get more... I'm not even talking about consoles, he is out of damn pokemon BS. I asked about some stupid Thor hammer ... yea.. back  ordered for at least a month, if even then.

The past week I have seen GME shit talk and FUD from bad actors out the wood work. Accounts made in DEC, reactivated accounts, with no other DD or up votes on what we think. 

Fuck these guys. 

If you are GME gang ...DO NOT SELL YOUR SHARES!
Stand by the DD that the smarts on this sub provided months ago. 

I know it's hard when you see days down. This is a solid play. Even if there is no VW like squeeze, we will still see a $40-50 price because GME is actually worth that. I think more like 70ish if we can vote in RC. 

In closing: look at the users here spouting  FUD , look at the DD months back, look at why you bought into this in the first place. 

Ask yourself this weekend: can I take the 20% up and down, do I want gamestop  there for me, do I want to give BAC And Melvin my tendies? 

Well, when they give me red arrows, I the shade with small buys.

Do not buy 100 shares. Buy 1, or 2. Buy what you can buy. This is a win and a win that you can give to a solid company. 

Throw off the Melvin  FUD the BAC fud , I say  GME is  America And America is GME...

Step 1: After winning the lottery, think you can do it again
Step 2: Despite believing in Tesla and Elon Musk for years, try to time the market movements with options.  Watch Tesla go to all time highs and create millionaires as you go into debt.

At that point the election is in dispute and it falls to the House of Representatives to elect the President. Interestingly in this election each State delegation gets 1 vote - California gets one vote and so does South Dakota. Republicans control 26 of the State delegations in the current Cingress and 27 in the incoming Congress.

So TLDR If Biden dies before Jan 5, Trump can get elected President.

If Democrats win the Senate, we have a Trump Presidency with a Democrat house and Senate.

Why Salesforce ($CRM) is going to be the next SAP,1609497805,Mbhound,58,"I got two goals here. One is for you to understand what Salesforce and SAP really do instead of just ""cloud"" and ""software"" and why Salesforce will become like SAP. The second is to tell you what to expect with CRM price and how to make tendies.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First you gotta understand what exactly SAP does and what happened with their stock. SAP is one of the largest software companies which focus on ERP. What the fuck is ERP you might ask? ERP is what other businesses use to track business resources. This ranges from everything such as planning and optimizing manufacturing capacity to dealing with payroll for employees. Basically companies don't want to create their own software for handling these wide range of tasks and pay SAP a shit load of money to do it for them. Where's the problem you might ask? Unless you are involved with one of these companies that use SAP, it's difficult to understand what the experience is like. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/htsfvr8uro861.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db3b665c95ce5d62639a4dc0e5d9469a08510cbd

Basically a company pays SAP to use their software for dealing with one of these areas of ERP. This generally works fine since SAP has used their business management software with a lot of companies for the same tasks. The issue is when one of these companies want to [customize the software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning#Disadvantages) to meet unique demands for the company. This re-engineering process to fit the ERP system for many tasks ends up costing more for a company and wasting a lot of time and money. Interestingly enough, you can ask almost any business about their experience with SAP and they will all say that they're unhappy even though they use their software. So what you might ask, wouldn't SAP still be generating tons of revenue? Well yes but more of these companies are moving away from this way of doing ERP as it is an inflexible approach. This is becoming replaced by more loosely connected systems utilizing cloud instead of having a one solves all solution.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ugj07ez0to861.png?width=984&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c45c19bcdd0e10bd643286730aa3a2beeec0ae20

Let's look at how their financial earnings and stock price have reflected this. In the past two years this stock has traded relatively sideways with some really bad drops. Around May to August their stock price went up 60% do to the hype around cloud companies benefiting from COVID. However it has obviously taken a really bad fall when October earnings were announced. They claimed that there was slower recovery than anticipated for many of its clients. However I suspect that many of these companies have been looking to shift away from SAP as the pandemic has shown the importance of the flexibility of these systems. By looking at their past quarters, you can see that their quarterly revenue has been flat around the 8 billion range and the company is clearly having a difficult time changing their business model. Other cloud companies are replacing their solutions as SAP's clients move away from their software even though SAP is trying to shift to [modern cloud technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP#Corporate_restructuring). Generally though companies have a hard time changing their business approach from the old way of doing things to the new way of doing things. 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now the important part. What the fuck does SAP's troubles have to do with Salesforce. As you may have guessed from the ticker Salesforce provides CRM or customer relationship management. [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) is a specific area in ERP dealing with customer services. For example a company may want a software for their call center or to automate a marketing effort. Salesforce provides software to do this along with analytics of this data so that these businesses can make informed decisions.

As you may have already guessed Salesforce is facing some similar problems that SAP deal with. When a company decides to expand their CRM software to deal with more parts of their business, the inflexibility and costs quickly become apparent. [For example, many corporations only use CRM systems on a partial basis and less than 40 percent of companies have high end-user adoption rates.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management#Criticism) Again if you are not familiar with software development and companies using these software vendors it is difficult to fully understand these troubles. I would strongly recommend researching the issues of customizing ERP or CRM software for a specific company if you are not convinced. While Salesforce tries to provide an all in one solution for their clients, customization becomes complicated and prices become costly. These customizations become difficult to do and take a lot of time, planning, and money. Companies are becoming more inclined to take a different approach for building these systems. In a lot of these cases it is easier for a business to build their own system in the cloud using products from companies such as Microsoft or Amazon for more customizability. 

Another big issue is the concern over customer data with CRM systems. A company might opt to develop their own CRM systems where they can ensure that customer data is obeying customer privacy laws and allows them to have more control over private data. This can help build a better relationship with the customer. Privacy issues over customer data has obviously become a big issue in 2020.

Furthermore, Salesforce has been trying to get into more areas with [recent acquisitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce). Similar to SAP, I suspect that Salesforce will crush over their own weight as they try to expand their company. One good example of this is their recent acquisition of Slack. Slack does not really fit any of Salesforce ecosystem and is really just an attempt to expand into a different area. Slack has a lot of competition from Microsoft teams and other companies which can do what Slack does but better. 

Business will start to move away from Salesforce similar to SAP. This is not to say that they be completely independent as Salesforce does make some parts of the businesses easier. However there seems to be a strong resemblance to SAP based on what I know from inside of a corporation using both SAP and Salesforce and the many issues they face when they try and customize their solutions.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So how can we use this information to print tendies? The expectation is that Salesforce will eventually slow their growth down while stock is overhyped due to being a cloud company and start to fall or go sideways like SAP. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vl629rb14p861.png?width=927&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4282ffef17bd83b9a62a7f196974d0113511b1d5

Basically the idea is to try and play puts, especially around earnings. If Salesforce misses their guidance then it could the stock in a serious reversal especially for a cloud company with a lot of hype. The next earnings will be early March.

You can also try and play longer term puts but the stock is fairly volatile like SAP and I would only do this if you see the price go up significantly.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr; buy puts in march

The TSLA 2021 Trade Plan,1609508025,notlikethis1994,56,"**TLDR:**

Tesla enters 2021 with huge tailwinds. Bullish for the first half of the year. More caution in the second half as competing EV products start entering the market at an accelerating pace. Biggest risk is the market discounting the effect of strong EV competition starting in 2021. Avoid shorting TSLA.

# The 2021 TSLA trade plan

## What moves the stock?

Knowing that TSLA is decoupled from its business metrics, an inquisitive investor will wonder what drives the stock's price. The answer is partially uncovered by understanding who owns the stock. According to Macroaxis.com, as of December 30th, Institutions own 42.52% of Tesla's stock, the Public (i.e. Retail Investors) owns 37.46%, and Insiders own 20.02%.

&gt;Institutional investors aren't selling

TSLA's institutional investor base consists of large passive funds such as funds tracking the S&amp;P500 (which recently added TSLA) to more active hedge funds specializing in innovation and growth. Passive funds increase the buying pressure of TSLA while adding minimal selling pressure. Today, the majority of the workforce regularly contributes their salary to passive funds for retirement and said funds are unlikely to trim their holdings of a stock unless during an infrequent rebalancing event. The active funds that remain invested in TSLA tend to have celestial expectations for the company and are also unlikely to sell at this valuation. For example, billionaire fund manager Ron Baron believes that Tesla, currently at a $659 billion market cap, should be a $2 trillion dollar company. Another major fund manager, Cathie Wood, gives TSLA a 2024 price target of $7,000. Assuming minimal changes in total float, that equates to almost a $7 trillion dollar market cap!

So TSLA's institutional investor base are hardly sellers of TSLA and still believe there is significant room for the stock to run despite its incredible 2020 performance.

&gt;Retail investors aren't selling

What about TSLA's retail investor base? This question is easily answered. Over the years, TSLA has built a diehard fanbase that has equally high, if not higher, expectations of the company than some of the institutional investors. Some people believe the company's CEO, Elon Musk, has developed a cult-of-personality. Tesla's cult-like fanbase manifests online as a large number of YouTube channels and online forums dedicated to the company, and in a broader sense, Elon Musk. For example, the main Tesla subreddit, r/ teslamotors, has more than 901,000 subscribers at the time of writing.

&gt;Insiders aren't selling

Of the remaining 20% of TSLA stock, the majority is held by Elon Musk and he's certainly not eager to sell noticeable quantities of his holdings given the ensuing bad PR.

So if investors are hesitant to sell TSLA, TSLA is bound to appreciate aggressively every time there's good news and appreciate slowly in the absence of news as passive funds and its ardent fanbase continue to buy in. In other words, TSLA is a heavily news-driven stock with a heavy bias for upside.

This is exactly what we saw in 2020. TSLA entered the year having solved its Model 3 production problems while managing to maintain solvent. This act alone unceremoniously discarded a dark cloud over the company on whether it'll manage to produce cars at scale before its heavy debt-burden catches up with the company's treasury. With that, the path was clear for a string of good news to catapult the stock to grandiose heights. They included the opening of the Shanghai factory, the 5-for-1 stock split, the S&amp;P500 inclusion, and record sales and deliveries in the third quarter. Even good news from the tangentially-related company SpaceX, who Elon Musk is also the CEO of, has been positive for TSLA.

# The Plan and Headwinds

Tesla will enter 2021 with boosted by tailwinds from its 2020 success. If Tesla maintains its current pace of execution, ceteris paribus (fancy business major speak for ""all other things being equal""), its stock price is expected to continue to appreciate and befuddle its critics. Tesla is finally able to produce Model 3's at scale, has a foothold in the Chinese market, and is readying to launch the Cybertruck to a red-hot North American pickup truck market. In addition, like Pavlov's dogs, 2020 has conditioned investors to not bet against TSLA with the stock shrugging off multiple negative news events like the COVID-19 pandemic, the expected post-S&amp;P500 inclusion sell-off (which never happened), and the Apple EV announcement.

**In 2021, it's recommended to continue to avoid shorting Tesla, no matter how tempting.**

With that said, there are significant headwinds facing Tesla that any long positions should be aware of. Tesla currently has an 81.66% market share of the US EV market. The biggest risk going into 2021 and beyond is the significant ramp up in EV and battery technology competition from legacy auto manufacturers. Tesla's stock price has only emboldened the executive teams of these companies to pour significant resources into their EV businesses. GM, Volkswagen, and Ford are leading the pack. GM has invested $27 billion into its EV business and is planning to launch 30 EVs by 2025. Two EVs have already been announced: the Cadillac Lyriq and the Hummer EV, with both receiving an overwhelmingly positive public response. GM has also developed an in-house battery technology called Ultium that's the central pillar for its 2025 plan. A step above GM, Volkswagen is investing $41 billion into its EV business and plans to launch 70 EVs by 2030. It's also aggressively investing in battery technology. For example, Volkswagen has a large stake in QuantumScape, a company that claims to be developing a revolutionary solid-state battery technology. Last but not least, Ford is investing $11 billion into its EV business and plans to launch 40 EVs by 2022. Deliveries of its flagship EV, the well-received Mustang Mach-E, is already underway. An honorable mention goes to Apple, which plans to start production of its own EV in 2024.

If TSLA is a news-driven stock, a growing string of negative news about the company's shrinking North American and European market share should apply downward pressure on price. The worry is that investors are so exuberant about the stock's stellar 2020 performance that the effects of emergent, serious competition from legacy auto manufacturers are heavily discounted.

**In 2021, although it remains very bullish for TSLA going into the first half of the year, it's recommended to avoid aggressively starting or adding more to an existing position in the latter half of the year. This is when the rate of competing EV products entering the North American and European markets is expected to accelerate. Prudent investors should watch how the public reacts to this large structural EV market change before making any moves.**

Palantir and Mithril cool names from LOTR or do they have meanings?,1609510241,Bright_Percentage_39,27,"Conspiracy time;

Palantir:

 'A ***palantÃ­r*** ([/ËˆpÃ¦lÉ™nËŒtÉªÉ™r/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English); *pl.* ***palantÃ­ri***) is a fictional magical [artefact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(fantasy)) from [J. R. R. Tolkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien)'s [Middle-earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth) [legendarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolkien%27s_legendarium). A *palantÃ­r* (from [Quenya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenya) *palan*, 'far; *tir*, 'watch over'[\[T 1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palant%C3%ADr#cite_note-1)) is described as an indestructible [ball of crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_ball), used for communication and to see events in other parts of [Arda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arda_(Middle-earth)), whether past or future.' - Is this what Palantir will do in the future? See the past or future with their powerful programmes?

Mithril:

The scholar of English literature Charles A. Huttar writes that *mithril* was the only mineral that Tolkien invented. He notes that in Tolkien's underworld, whether the [caves at Helm's Deep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glittering_Caves_of_Aglarond) or the mines of Moria, ""beauty and terror \[were\] side by side"".[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithril#cite_note-Huttar_1975-12) Greed for *mithril* could unleash the terror of the [Balrog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balrog), by digging too far down into the dark realm, but at the same time, he writes, the metal was prized for both its beauty and its usefulness, yielding the best armour. He compares the Dwarves' greed for *mithril* with that of the Barrow-wights for treasure, and indeed that of the [dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon) in [*The Hobbit*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit) and [*Beowulf*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf) for gold. In his view, these symbolise the evil ""inherent in the mineral treasures hidden in the womb of Earth"",[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithril#cite_note-Huttar_1975-12) just as mining and metalwork are associated with [Satan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan) in [John Milton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milton)'s [*Paradise Lost*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost) (I, 670-751). Huttar sums up with a reflection on Tolkien's moral vision in the story: just as the characters at every point have to decide for good or ill, so objects have the potential to be both good and evil: ""Mithril is both the greatest of treasures and a deadly bane. 

Does Peter Thiel actually use the names that have meanings behind them on what the company is going to achieve or is it just some cool names chosen from the LOTR universe?

As we can see Mithril can be used for good and ill, will that be the case with Palantir? If it gets in the wrongs hands could that bring a deadly bane or if it gets into the good hands could that bring the greatest treasure?

Does that basically mean I am too retarded or are we going to the moon on this rocket  ðŸš€ ?"

Fulfilling my Ryan Gosling Big Short fantasy by throwing my life savings into DoorDash puts,1609513061,NelsonTingles,386,"DoorDash is currently sitting at $142 per share, down 22% from $182 when retail investors were able to buy at IPO. Only \~10% of its 286M outstanding shares are available to trade due to its lockup period, giving it a float of 20M shares.

Here's where things get interesting. If you take a look at page 91 of their S-1 filing ([Go to page 91 to confirm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm#rom752207_9) ), existing shareholders PRE-IPO purchased 284M shares at $8.73. Company employees who purchased shares at that price are salivating at a current 1,628% profit. Early lockup period expires 90 days after IPO, meaning that 90% of outstanding shares (284M shares once again) that currently can't be traded and were purchased at $8.73 will be released into the market available to trade. Regardless of what you think about valuation and possible future growth of DoorDash (which is already ridiculously overpriced and they had the worst IPO in history), any rational employee will dump their holdings immediately for that 10 bagger profit.

Now considering present conditions, the price action is ridiculous. Looking at the level 2 data, there is almost no retail volume, and any trades made throughout the day are by MMs trying to keep this stock liquid. Volume from the past 2 days has already dropped by 50%. Literally NO ONE wants to buy this POS. The price is pinned at $140, with retail dips that are immediately bought up by manipulation. If you look at the 1 minute chart yesterday, it traded at literally $140 throughout the day and suddenly spiked to 146 in a manner of 3 minutes before slowly settling down to $142. This thing is manipulated as fuck, and as soon as MMs are exhausted it will crash regardless of the aforementioned S-1 filing.

I have 175 contracts of 5/21 $80 puts. I'm betting $87k I can look back at this post in 5 months and pretend I'm reenacting The Big Short as Ryan Gosling. More than likely, I'll probably have to start driving for DoorDash and moonlight sucking weens behind the restaurants I just made a delivery from.

Looking for any serious counterarguments on why this play might be retarded."

**Options Trading Rules**

Always remember: **â€œBulls Make Money, Bears Make Money,** **Pigs Get Slaughtered****!â€**

1. Open and read these points before every trade you make.

2. Buy options that are no less than 4 weeks from expiring. Ideally, they would have at least 8 weeks until expiration or longer.

3. Buy calls or puts at the money or close to it. 

4. STOP JUMPING INTO STOCKS THAT YOU HAVE NOT MONITORED FOR AT LEAST 1-2 WEEKS.

a. This will give you an idea of what the stock is doing and the type of price action you are stepping into. 

b. If you miss out before entry, move on to another stock. They are plenty of stocks in the sea. 

5. Remember past events or trade outcomes will not determine how a new trade works out. If the stock is not going in the direction you thought it would GET OUT! Do not waste time wondering why and or going against what the price action is saying or doing. 

6. As much as you can, remove your emotions. Become a robot when it comes to trading. 

7. STOP CHASING THE MONEY YOU HAVE LOST!!!!!!!

8. STOP ALLOWING YOURSELF TO HAVE DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR. Its okay to dream just not in stock trading. Take profits when you can. It is okay if you make 5-10% in a trade before pulling the trigger. Not every trade will turn out to be 100% or 1000% return. 

9. Pay attention when Cramer pounds the table about a stock. Buy long dated Calls.

10. YOU NEED VOLUME for a stock to move. If the Volume is not there, move on or check again later."

# Introduction

**Happy New Year!** **TL;DR- I am going to double a small account over a year, and you are going to watch.**

Three months ago I wrote up a guide on consistently outperforming the S&amp;P500 using Theta Gang strategy. That guide got a lot of positive feedback, and I suggest those who missed it take a look. [How to CONSISTENTLY Outperform the S&amp;P500 using Theta Gang Strategy. A Comprehensive Guide to Wheeling ETFs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz68r4/how_to_consistently_outperform_the_sp500_using/) And if you are truly retarded check out my recent Tips for Noobies. [Top 5 Tips Every Noobie Trader MUST Know.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4ztif/top_5_tips_every_noobie_trader_must_know/)

I've since decided to put my skills to the test and will attempt to double a small $8000 account by the end of 2021 using similar strategies. This will mostly be an educational experience, and I will walk you through all my thought processes and my trades as I make them so hopefully the retards among you can learn a thing or two. And if I blow up the account, that will be entertaining as well, right?

Some of the less experienced among you may think this is a simple feat. The more experienced among you will know achieving such consistently high returns will be an incredibly difficult feat. I put my odds of success somewhere around 20% to be honest. But it will be a good education for both of us. Really, I only need to achieve around 6% return every month to break 100% by the end of the year (after compounding), and put in those terms the task doesn't sound so daunting, does it?

Still, I will be forced to make some very aggressive, downright risky plays in order to make this remotely possible. If my wheeling ETF guide was about a safe, conservative strategy, this guide will be the opposite. Keep that in mind if you are foolish enough to copy my trades. 

Wish me luck... I will need it.

# Basic Strategy

I will not leave any tool off the table here. If I see an opportunity, I will take it. But for the majority of my trades I will be using a very simple strategy. Find high implied volatility stonks and sell options on them. I will typically be selling cash-secured puts since naked calls carry excess risk, which means I want to look for stocks I am generally bullish on long-term.

Using ToS I've set up some very basic filters to scan for promising stocks to trade:

**1) Option Implied Volatility &gt;80% (for tendies)**

**2) Stock Volume &gt;5,000,000 (for liquidity)**

**3) Market Cap &gt;$1B (to comply with WSB rules)**

**4) Stock Price &lt;$82 (collateral maximum)**

Scanning with these filters brings up a lot of familiar names: GME, PLTR, QS, NKLA, LAZR, FCEL, UVXY, ACB, XPEV, SPCE, and so on. In other words, the type of stonks retards like you are buying expensive options on...

# Running the Numbers

I will try to not get too technical and into the weeds with this experiment. I'll be using some very basic math to decide which options to sell. I highly recommend you play around with the numbers on options to really get an intuitive feel for how they work. For example, if I were to ask you what happens to the relative cost of premium ($/day) as DTE increases on an option, what would be your answer? If you don't know, just run some simple numbers to find out...

SPY premium / DTE = $/day

332 / 5 = 66.4

440 / 10 = 44

652 / 21 = 31

1915 / 140 = 13.7

As you can see, premium cost per day decreases as time till expiration increases. (It's more complicated than that of course, but we are keeping it simple here). For that reason I will be doing something I generally don't advocate: Selling weeklies to squeeze a bit of extra juice out of my options. This also means I will be holding them all to expiration to deal with issues like higher gamma.

Here is another simple equation I can use to give me a lot of information:

**(Premium \* 365) / (DTE \* Strike) = Max ROI**

Basically what I'm doing is estimating the returns from selling the same option for an entire year with a 100% success rate. Since I'm aiming for 100% ROI, any options I sell will need to be over 100 in this formula. Of course, I won't have a 100% success rate on my trades, so I should probably aim even higher to give myself some buffer, maybe around 120. Let's try it on some \~ATM options to get a relative comparison of option value:

SPY: 12.2

PSTH: 48.1

GME: 140.5

PLTR: 111.1

QS: 263.7

UVXY: 134.2

Don't put too much stock in these numbers. I'm just using them as a simple comparative tool for judging the profitability of different options.

We can glean even more information from the above number if we multiply it by the Prob. ITM% of course, to get something closer to an ""Expected Value"" for an option, which I will perhaps go into more detail on next month.

Finally I'll be throwing around various other calculations as I go, $/day, ROI/month, premium/collateral, and so on. I will need to watch all of these and more to reach my goal.

# My First Trade

Looking at the stocks in my filter, there are two that really stand out to me: GME and PLTR. That's right, everyones favorite meme stocks!

GameStop is interesting as a short-term play, and has very high IV. But I'm not confident in the company as a long-term play, and would hate to be assigned hundreds of shares of that shitty brick and mortar hellscape. Palantir, on the other hand, has serious growth potential long-term and I would not mind being assigned. It has also been hit hard recently and is at a more reasonable entry level, which also makes it a good choice. **Therefore, I will be trading PLTR as my first play.**

I want to sell an OTM put to give myself some downside protection against a further drop, but not so far OTM that I can't break my 100% ROI goal. Let's plug some of the Jan. 15 options into my formula above to get a breakdown of the potential ROI.

21 strike: 74.2

22 strike: 108.4

22.5 strike: 131.9

23 strike: 155.5

Either the 22 or 22.5 strikes are right near the sweet spot we are looking for in terms of return. Of course conditions will likely change on Monday and I may need to reassess, but at the moment my current play seems to be:

**Sell to Open 3 contracts of PLTR 22p 1/15.**

If Monday opens red it will be even better for us, since we get in at a cheaper price with likely higher IV on top. So I for one am praying for a bloody Monday for Palantir (sorry bagholders).

Of course after selling 3 contracts at 22 strike, we will only have used $6600 of our $8000 capital. I may need to look for one more smallish trade on a stock in the $14 range to take full advantage of our capital. If GME drops on Monday we could consider a far OTM play there, for instance.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR- I am going to double a small account, and you are going to watch.**

I will update this post as plays are made, and will create a new post each month as a recap. As always questions are welcome."

GME Reality and Fantasy Prediction,1609521660,caverypca,139,"  GME is going to have a BIG week.
Here is why:

- RC plays like a chess grandmaster 
- 2 large buys on 12/30 (one intraday and one AH)
- 1st buy came just before RCâ€™s tweets (mocking bears and warning that they are figuratively about to be burned alive in a house fire)
- Both large buys came in around the lows of the day
- QTR 4 in March will be a blowout
- Conference on Jan 8
- Probable release of holiday sales figures before conference
- Ridiculous % of shares sold short
- Hype on this stock is ratcheting up
- $600 stim checks are already in many of our accounts

How much more pain can the short sellers take? 

My crazy prediction/fantasy:

I think we go up 5% by 10 AM Monday,  Jan 4th. 

If a 13d comes out, we are looking at an immediate jump to $28 per share. From there, we go into a 3 day squeeze that will take us past $30 on day 1 (probably Tuesday Jan 5th by noon). On day 2 GME flys by $40, $50, $60, and momentarily hits $140 pps until it settles down around $80 pps by close on Day 3, which would be Thursday Jan 7th.

just on the same day. All were near the lows of the day.

RC felt antagonized. He already planned to buy shares, he did it yesterday, probably twice around $19 per share just on the same day. All were near the lows of the day.

RC felt antagonized. He already planned to buy shares, he did it yesterday, probably twice around $19 per share 
donâ€™t see it going down this coming week. Stimulus checks are out. The hype for this stock is ratcheting up. Plus, RC is making more veiled threats via Twitter and mocking the bears. 

RC is playing this like a Chess Grandmaster. Iâ€™m predicting another 13d to come out this Monday or Tuesday around 10/11ish AM.

Again, all of this is probably just wishful thinking. But, it may come true."

Iâ€™ve been doing quite a bit of research on Palantir. Thereâ€™s a few objectives for my research. 
1: To actually understand what it is.

2: To assess the long term growth potential.

3: To assess possible competition and how that could thwart market domination

Through all of this I became very excited initially. 

As this seems to be a free thinking pathway that can intermediate between pseudo â€œsubconsciousâ€ types of data relationships that would be unexplored by 99% of other data platforms.

Then I became quite terrified, really. 
This data is being used by central governments for the most part and huge corporations.

This is the medium between the value of data and the implications of everything that could be done with the amounts of data with no stone left unturned.

Not all of it will be good, that can be assured.

https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/about

From Covid tracking to ICE deportations. Palantir has data on otherwise low data groups with not much of a digital footprint.

The thing is that people like you and I, who have a massive data footprint will be most susceptible to the ways it uses data over the next few decades.

Maybe around Christmas or New Year's time.  9 months later in 2021 got lucky and dodged the bullet, but 2021 and 2022 we are still quarantined because this shit virus keeps mutating.

Come 2023 many babies born because boomer parents want grandkids before they go to the moon.  Need to buy diamond rings for the gf's diamond hands.  Profit off of GME and TSLA and then buy Tiffany sparkly ring for gf so that she leaves you alone when you lose tendies.  All loss forgiven when you buy Tiffany sparkly ring.

TIF as of today is at $131.45 been like this literally for months.  Limp like a limp bizkit but hasn't fallen off the cliff.  They are in litigation with Luis Vouton.  Gonna win.  Many autists buying rings and winning against Luis Vouton will bring this and your boomers to the moon.

Look over the list of stocks that have more than tripled in 2020 and GameStop has to jump out at you. GameStop? Really. The small-box video game retailer is one of this year's biggest winners despite wrapping up what will be its third consecutive fiscal year of declining sales. We're not buying physical games these days, and that's bad news for a model that relies on folks trading in their used games and gear for in-store credit.

We're kicking off a new console cycle, but hardware is always the lowest-margin business here. Once you score your PS5 you're not going to come back to GameStop for games the way you did in the past. GameStop used to be a cash-generating machine, but it's been three years since it turned an annual profit. The once beefy dividend was nixed two years ago.

A short squeeze has propped the stock higher, and the market's underestimating what a new console cycle will mean for GameStop. This game was over before it even started, and GameStop -- like DoorDash and SeaWorld -- will be a silent wealth killer in 2021.

QuantumScape [Real DD],1609531497,twenty94025,41,"**VW**

* **How did get tied up with QS?**
   * The VW CEO Martin Winterkorn son (also named Martin) works/worked for one of the QS Founder (Prof Prinz) at Stanford.
   * [http://npl-archive.stanford.edu/people/?m=134](http://npl-archive.stanford.edu/people/?m=134)
   * [http://npl-archive.stanford.edu/people/](http://npl-archive.stanford.edu/people/)
   * CEO Winterkorn resigned from VW (Dielgate) in  2015, but VW completed their first investment in QS in 2014 (and had a 'relationship' with QS since 2012 (according to the recent QS presentation))
* **Guess**: VW ""diesel-gate"" caused VW to bet bigger on clean-tech like QS, since they were already down the plan.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tech**

* **Prototype cell**:  Single-layer and 30 x 30 mm (1.1811 inch x 1.1811 inch)
   * The small size, which is quite far away from a commercial size cell makes be doubt if the results will scale to commercial size cells.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Lack of Energy Density Data**:  This is usually measured in Watt-hour/weight or Watt-hour/volume (Wh/kg or Wh/L).  QS shows a graph with their energy density at 1,000 Wh/L, but it wasn't backed up with any data, so it just looked like a goal.
   * Another point is that, when you have a 'solid' battery like QS, with no liquid electrolyte, you need  some additional materials to create the ionic conductivity between the anode and cathode (an anolyte and catholyte). No liquid electrolyte is good, since it reduces the ""explosivity"" of the battery.  But some in the industry think that, the need for an anolyte and catholyte, will cause the battery to have a lower energy density, and therefore not make economical sense.

&amp;#x200B;

*  **Solid State Separator (SSS**):  QS's main technical achievement is in the SSS, which separates the anode from the cathode.  Why hasn't anyone developed a good SSS yet?
   * **Perfect surface:**  The SSS needs to have perfect surface qualities.  If not, dendrites grow, and end up breaking through the SSS, and shorting out the anode and cathode (think of sticking a 2-prong fork into your electric outlet).
      * **Manufacturing Costs**: To create these perfect surfaces, requires technology more similar to semiconductor manufacturing than battery manufacturing equipment.  Semicon equipment is very expensive and doesn't have high-throughput (yes, when you're selling a &lt; 0.5"" square chip for $100+, it makes sense, but when you scale up to battery sizes, it doesn't make economical sense).
      * **Thin**: In order to keep energy density high the SSS needs to be thin, but the thinner it gets, the less strong it is.
      * **Fragile**: These thin and perfect SSS's are somewhat fragile, so in order to not degrade over the 100k mile life in a car, the battery pack needs to have more cushioning and other structures to make sure the SSS doesn't crack.   
      * **High Temperatures**:  SSS's conduct electricity best when they are warm 30C+.  This is why the main QS results are done at 30C and 45C.  Yes, QS shows some data at lower temperatures, but if QS's SSS worked well at lower temps, why weren't all the results shown at room temp (20F or 68F)?
      * Also needing equipment to warm up your batteries, takes up more battery-pack volume, therefore decreases the energy-density, and increase cost and complexity. 

Thank you for listening to my TED talk! I'm not a battery engineering, but I have been reading up a lot about batteries since the announcement of the SPAC and I hope you found this useful, please let me know if I have some wrong assumptions/ideas here."

PLTR's Foundry Managing Global Food Aid Distribution,1609531677,msg582,19,"It has been really great to see so many WSB members supporting their local food banks. So it gave me a great big philanthropic boner to see Palantir's Foundry platform beginning to manage The World Food Programme's global distribution network. 

[https://medium.com/world-food-programme-insight/coronavirus-world-food-programme-harnesses-data-and-tech-to-save-lives-c57c2b9e22ea](https://medium.com/world-food-programme-insight/coronavirus-world-food-programme-harnesses-data-and-tech-to-save-lives-c57c2b9e22ea)

 For those of you who can barely read the most important pull quote from the article is: ""Over time, Marketplace will expand to cover all WFP-provided services,  cargo transport by air, land and sea, storage, procurement, emergency  telecommunications, engineering support and more, facilitating response  to all emergencies beyond COVID-19."" The TDLR being that Foundry is positioned to grow into the backbone of UN humanitarian relief efforts going forward. 

Think about it, Palantir is helping deliver actual tendies all around the globe!"
If youâ€™re a retard that lost money this year you should read this,1609532119,Aordex96,69,"If you dumbass lost money last year. You can deduct your losses on your tax return. This loss is limited to $3,000 per year (single or married filing jointly)

If your wife has a boyfriend (married filing separately) then you can only write off $1500 per year

Now if youâ€™re a special type of retarded and you lost more than $100,000 you get to do tax write off for at least the next 34 years if not the rest of your life. Congratulations too you

TLDR: Youâ€™re getting a tax write off congratulations (money loss / ($3000 or $1500 if your wife has a boyfriend) and thatâ€™s how many years you get a write off for"

You guys like WFC?,1609535134,ChimiChangas2020,8,"Like this trade. But I think itâ€™s more of a shares play...long term hold where you donâ€™t want to pay theta. But my god I love this.

Shares play Bc overtime they will up div back to 3-4%. When that happens share price will be much higher 40-50. Buying shares now basically you are locking in a higher effective yield. 4% on 50 is 2 bucks every year. 2 bucks on original 30 dollar cost is 6.66% effective yield on your original share purchase. 

Thatâ€™s why I like this. Thereâ€™s a good chance you lock in 6-7% positive carry with even more upside for years, possibly decades. Dividend upping should happen in 2021 when fed allows banks to up dividend again...and div will keep growing."

How i ended up divorcing my wife because of WSB,1609535474,Lucky-Designer3469,78," From the time I was a child I dreamed my life would be a fairy tale - not a divorce story. I dreamed that I'd meet an amazing guy, find a great Job , and live happily ever after. But sometimes the path to that happy ending takes a few wicked turns along the way.

I thought the way to move ahead in life looked like this: do well in school, get into a great college, Understand Charts and Movements to day trade options, get married, have kids, and my reward for all of this would be to live with my love happily ever after. And it all started out that way...

I met my future wife shortly after I turned 19. she was a senior in the Chemical Engineering program and I was a freshman. To say we were smitten with each other is an understatement. i proposed 4 months after we met and she accepted without a second thought. 6 months later, we were hitched.

We moved a lot during the first few years, she never understood day trading more times then not bash me for not having a real job , and then we took a brake from society and went to sea . It took a toll on our marriage and we continued to grow apart over the years. As you can imagine, we were more roommates than spouses. We went to a marriage counselor, but it really didnâ€™t help. We wanted different things and no amount of compromise on either of our parts would allow us to deny the inevitable: Her biggest pet Peeve was the lack of a job . Of course day trading in general isnt a ""job"" but i made joblike figures . She wanted a man that was ""handy"" and ""manly"" not some ""bum"" like me. The amount of money i made day trading was decent . Made 20k sense the beginning of the pandemic . But she hated how it wasn't a real job , she wanted to see a ""real Job"" how im not no Average man , im a pussy.

I felt tremendously guilty because I took my vows seriously; to me forever meant forever and I had broken that promise. I couldnâ€™t sleep, my mind raced all night, and it led me down the path of anorexia. It was a very dark time for me.

But, luckily, I had friends and family who loved me and helped me see the light. Most of them had never been through divorce and didnâ€™t really know how to help me, but they were always there whenever I reached out to them. I also worked with a therapist and took a divorce recovery class. Both helped me tremendously as I slowly found my way back to the land of the living. I was a newly singled woman and the rest of my life was right in front of me waiting for me to jump in and play. I really could continue creating my happily ever after instead of my life end with a tragic tale of divorce."

January 9: GME releases December sales numbers.

January 11: The Conference where Papa Cohen himself presents his vision and roadmap for GME and gathers institutional buyers.

Worse case scenario, you lose the same amount you owe on taxes from the free money and you write it off and break out even. Best case scenario, you get more free money. Which is what happened. I believe this is why the stock market went up so much."
$BBBY Short squeeze plan,1609536696,FrogoftheNorth,23,"Here is my take on $BBBY 6 days before their Q3 ER.

After a big change in management now led by Mark Tritton, $BBBY has managed to crawl back from the dead by shutting down numerous stores, selling the Cost Plus World Market and significantly improving the online shopping, which has played a large part in BBBY's success story.  All the company's debt has now been paid off and they have announced a large share buyback plan.

$BBBY managed to beat their Q2 estimate by $0,73 which resulted in $BBBY skyrocketing 70%. After that the stock has fallen 33% and has at the moment over 60% short float. 

All aforementioned information means that a large ðŸŒˆðŸ» trap has been set and we are going to see a massive short-squeeze. Q3 earnings are supposed to be positive and are going to function as a catalyst to brutalize the bears. Combining it with the January effect, $BBBY has set its course to the Moon and the engines have been fired up.

Possible risks:
-$BBBY fell through its support line at $18 per share. There is a large gap to fill and although unlikely, the fall to $15 is not impossible.
-According to Yahhoo Finance $BBBY has formed a bearish Top Triangle pattern. A bullish Falling Wedge pattern has also taken form in 1 day chart but in my opinion patterns won't play a large role in this short-squeeze.
-Average analyst rating is 2,6. Who really cares tho.

TLDR:
-Possible short-squeeze incoming
-60% short float
-Q3 ER in 6 days, likely to beat the estimated earnings
-$BBBY has fallen almost 20% during December, great time to buy.
-Buy shares not options.
-Medium risk - High reward"

stock has taken a hit since earnings where they beat both top and bottom line.  sure they did not give guidance but they have traditionally been conservative in forward performance.  couple of upgrades this past week as well and looks to have bottomed per the daily.

price hit a tested support level of roughly 258ish on 31Dec. this level was tested and held a couple of times since late Oct.

weeklies are cheap, sub 30 IV.  On verge of being oversold.

problem is i could see this stock going sideways for a bit, not much conviction out there... that i know of.  lacks a vol squeeze which i like to target.

If a deal isn't struck, that is a-OKAY! You get free money! For every 9 shares that you own and if Ackman fails, you get $500 gift card for Herbalife Nutrition. Ha! Not gunna happen!

Its the greatest single company that ever did exist.

If you buy tomorrow at $29 you are getting in earlier.

This thing is going to $750 by mid-week next week.

Ackman has already announced a 200:1 stock split meaning the stock will trade from 750 to $3.75. That means a lot for you! You can buy it for 3 bucks! Great. Really bigly great.

If the mods don't pin this, that would be egregious!

Double your money! Buy PSTH!

GME careers as a reflection of their roadmap,1609545976,cxi-trader,41,"I always find interesting how companies' available jobs could hint at the future state of the execution of their roadmap. In the case of $gme you can find a few interesting things to observe:

\- eCommerce investments (keyword Omnichannel): [https://careers.gamestop.com/en-US/search?facetcategory=ecommerce](https://careers.gamestop.com/en-US/search?facetcategory=ecommerce) . Although it is in my opinion a very poor initial effort (only 2 job postings), it could be the start of the effort to hire the core leadership team first.

\- Technology: [https://careers.gamestop.com/en-US/search?facetcategory=information%20technology%2Fecommerce%20technology](https://careers.gamestop.com/en-US/search?facetcategory=information%20technology%2Fecommerce%20technology) . As can be seen here (also only 2 job postings).

It is clear that $gme lacks the engineering caliber to execute RC's vision and the board; as of today, is not quite showing that they are taking the necessary steps to pursue reinventing the business. Looking forward to the upcoming events and announcements in 2021 Q1 and Q2.

Potential in coming real estate dip in 2021. Are there any non-idiots among us that work in this space and want to share their thoughts?,1609547783,myNameIsPDT,158,"TLDR: I have no fucking clue what I am talking about. It looks like the housing market is ready to decline in late 2021, maybe as soon as the spring. I am considering selling my rental house soon... obviously so I can yolo more into GME, PLTR, and SPCE - I can't help myself and I don't want help. If this happens, REITs might dip further, making for a nice entry point.

&amp;#x200B;

Home prices have been steadily rising the last five or so years to the point  we are seeing a spike in the inflation adjusted housing costs. It looks  like we are at the 07/08 highs again.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r6on75066t861.png?width=739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bac32713ff598bab5431b52ae7d8e45332340ba

I have been following the forbearance rates since covid started, and it looks like many of the national lenders have forbearance rates in the 3-6% range, still.  Historically these are under 1% for all lenders. If these eventually  turn into delinquencies after the forbearance period expires and covid  eviction protections expire, I am worried we might see a surge in  foreclosures and thus a flood of cheap real estate hitting the market, thus drastically reducing home prices in the second half of 2021.

I'll  walk you through the timing I am seeing. 

* The majority of forbearance  requests were made in March - June (the MBA has been publishing this  data). 
* These periods usually last 180 days,  based on historical forbearance periods. 
* And I believe these periods can  be extended for up to one year, which is also part of covid relief.
* The  national average number of delinquent payments on a mortgage before  foreclosure is about four.
* For those with 180 day forbearance periods started in March- June of 2020, it looks like this: 6 months forbearance + 4 months delinquency = 10 months, which puts these foreclosures on the market in February 2021-May 2021.
* For those with 365 day forbearance periods started in March- June of 2020, it looks like this: 12 months forbearance + 4 months delinquency = 16 months, which puts these foreclosures on the market in July 2021- October 2021.
* Finally, for those who were delinquent prior to covid, and would have been evicted during covid, the eviction protection has prevented banks from foreclosing, so these homes will hit the market in February 2021, after the eviction protections expire on January 31st 2021. Foreclosures are down 80% this year because of this.

&amp;#x200B;

If  we check FRED and look at delinquent payment on real estate over the  last 20 years, we can see about 10% of homes and real estate were in delinquency by 2010 (below). If all the current forbearances turn into  delinquent payments, which turn into foreclosures, we could see a 2-6%  spike by the end of the summer, or a 2-6x increase in foreclosure  based real estate hitting the market. Plus we need to add in the 80% of foreclosures that will hit post eviction moratorium. That would be about 2/3s the delinquency rate we saw post financial crisis, which would could cause quite a dip in home prices.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 5rr035o96t861...*

The current market is also further magnified buy the shortage of homes for sale, in part due to the lack of foreclosures due to the eviction moratorium. You can see below, the US is at an all time low for monthly supply  of houses, dating back to 1960.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4136uv3c6t861.png?width=1174&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=859c31a721b63b5c01f787d6cfec5ae387a8700e

When you combine a low supply with a relatively high demand (see housing  sales the last two years, below), this creates a pretty expensive market based  on supply and demand. Also, interest rates are low, so people can afford more, so housing prices are higher as a result.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/abfzz0he6t861.png?width=1179&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd698a8aefca84c6318c3c74da02ec2293b7aa19

In agreement with this, home prices are the highest in history as well  (below), even when adjusted for inflation (first figure of the post).

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img nhdsp7bh6t861...*

&amp;#x200B;

This could easily turn  into a serious situation in which a sudden spike in foreclosures and  cheap real estate could cascade into a pretty swift crash, and  significantly reduce the value of real estate around the country by a  huge margin.

Does  anyone here have any real expertise on this matter? I am a complete  newb and idiot. I don't know what I am doing, I am just speculating. I  would greatly appreciate an expert's opinion on the matter.

DD - Digital Marketing,1609548447,Kitties-N-Titties-11,24,"Ladies, Gentleman, ðŸŒˆðŸ»'s, and random OnlyFans hoes I see on here always begging for money, here is my first attempt at DD in this god forsaken sub. Unfortunately, I left my TA crayons at home, so I'll try to indent and tab over my walls of text as much as possible so that you Zoomers can pay attention to at least 1/4 of it.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*I do want to clarify that some of the timing of iOS 14 changes could get changed and Facebook could push back against certain parts of the change. I did my best to explain the basics of what I think is going on, but it is possible that I miscommunicated or misunderstood some parts of the iOS 14 update, so digital marketers, feel free to let me know in the comments and I'll edit accordingly\*\*\*

\-------------------------------

# TL;DR - Apple's iOS 14 - ""Get Zucked, Zuckerberg,"" Said Tim Cook

For reasons that will be explained below, it is possible that Google and Facebook will begin seeing their duopoly slowly diminish over the next several years (probably &gt;7 years, based on how ""fast"" Turtle Mitch is able to get anything done). I do believe that Google and Facebook will continue to be the top two players in the game for the foreseeable future **(SO I AM NOT RECOMMENDING SHORTING THESE AT ALL YOU ðŸŒˆ NOOBS).** 

The core problems that these companies will soon face, especially Facebook, is [anti-trust law suits from the FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization), more distrust of their platform due to the most recent election, censorship across both platforms, a complete failure of Facebook to properly address the negative side effects of social media on the youth and actually do something about it, and, most importantly, **Apple upgrading to iOS 14 (explained more later).** 

* [The Anti-Trust Law Suit from the FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization) talks about Facebook becoming a monopoly and buying all the competition such as Instagram and WhatsApp, instead of competing against them.
* [iOS 14](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2020/08/30/ios-14-facebooks-apple-nightmare-keeps-getting-worse/?sh=3029be574cfe) update will roll out early 2021. This will hinder the collection of iPhone identifiers for advertisers ([IDFA](https://www.appsflyer.com/mobile-attribution-glossary/idfa/)), one of the primary things used to track users online.

\-------------------------------

Primary Issues For Facebook From The iOS 14 Update

1. &gt;!Bidding Issues:!&lt; As I stated above, Facebook is going to lose more and more data points as  time goes on, making it so that they aren't able to bid appropriately on someone like Johnny Bravo when he is scrolling through his insta feed. What does this mean? Insta may look at Johnny Bravo as a Joe Schmo and decide that he's not worth bidding up on, so Johnny Bravo will never see those ads of Playboy and Whey Protein that he would have bought if he got an ad for it. (Example for this: with the iOS14 update, Facebook loses its data points to Johnny Bravo's workout apps, so they had no way of knowing he would have been more likely to convert.
2. &gt;!Creating Audiences:!&lt;Facebook is going to lose thousands of data points on its users, effectively making it harder to match these audiences into their appropriate buckets. Before, if someone had several golf apps on their phone, you could assume they were a golf lover more easily. Without being able to use that app data sharing, it will be much harder to know they like golf unless they follow several golfing pros / shows in Facebook.

\-------------------------------

With the expectation that Facebook will become less efficient as time goes on and that certain lawsuits could negatively affect the company, many advertisers are looking for other viable options to put their ad dollars. There have been several social media competitors working to monetize their app and become the third wheel of digital marketing. Some of these companies include:  


* PINS - Pinterest ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
* SNAP - Snapchat ðŸš€
* TWTR - Twitter ðŸš€
* Twitch - (Owned by Amazon aka AMZN) ðŸš€ðŸš€
* LNKD - LinkedIn (Owned by Microsoft aka MSFT) ðŸš€
* Hulu Ads - (Owned by Disney aka DIS) ðŸš€ðŸš€
* TikTok - Not sure if correct, but you may be able to get shares [here](https://www.ig.com/en/shares/ipos/bytedance-tiktok-ipo) (ticker tbd, but pretty sure it will be ZOOMR ðŸš€

The name of the game is trying figuring out which of these new channels will be the next to gain 5-10% more market share of ad spend from clients and which will be nothing more than moneyless pits since they do a terrible job at monetizing their app and creating engaging ads that lead to conversions for clients (looking at you SNAP and TikTok).

\-------------------------------

MY RECENT BACKGROUND (aka why should you even bother listening to this autist):

* **Worked in digital marketing and finance for the last 5 years**, also took on several side jobs doing digital marketing for companies
   * **I managed &gt;$10 million in ad spend across various digital marketing channels (Google/Bing/Facebook/Shopping) over the last 30 days** and over &gt;$40 million in ad spend over the last year
   * I work with a team of Managers and Directors at my agency to help talk about new opportunities and keep up with digital marketing trends across all channels
   * Using our &gt;300 clients data, our company is able to look at macro trends at a faster rate, so we can quickly identify which new channels to focus our efforts in (Pinterest/TikTok/Snap/Twitch/etc.)
      * This was highlighted over the last year or year and a half when we noticed a huge spike in companies using Pinterest as a primary channel for digital marketing. Only more and more companies are going to join into the race, this is just the beginning.

\-------------------------------

# Any of these stocks or multiple could improve throughout the following years, but my money is on PINS ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

* Even with PINS recent run up in stock price, I think there is still plenty of time to buy this stock now.
   *  Our clients are continuing to spend more and more on the Pinterest ad platform and it is returning better performance metrics (ROAS/ROI) than most of the other mentioned channels. 
* Pinterest also relies on on targeting people based on boards they visit/follow/create, combined with using a search query method for ads, somewhat similar to Google's. **This means they don't have to rely as much on pixel data, like Facebook does, to create their audience targeting.**

&amp;#x200B;

# I think the safest way to make money on PINS is to buy stocks for the long term, but I know that doesn't get some of your little schlongs hard enough. 

* Their next earnings are on 2/4/21(after hours) and ***I fully expect them to smash expectations just like McConnell's dad smashed that turtle to give birth to Mitch.*** 
   * Look at PINS options that make sense to you for a little after earnings, preferably not 2/5, literally the day after earnings. But you do you boo.

In fact, every single award returns a 100% loss, while Reddit laughs their asses off for getting you autists to buy into their dopamine fueled trap. Science doesnâ€™t lie bitch, and if you actually spend money on these awards you simply hate money (or are retarded), thereâ€™s no other way to put it.

Donâ€™t tell me I didnâ€™t warn you, besides, itâ€™s much more fun to lose money options trading anyways. 


TLDR
Reddit â€œawardsâ€ are useless pixels and a (proven) waste of money, instead buy GME shares/calls, BBBY shares/calls, THCðŸ shares, NIO shares/calls, and buy the PLTR dip.

GME Gang GameStop.com 4Q20 Model Update,1609552826,Uberkikz11,160,"Happy New Year once again GME Gang! 

Okay, since you know that I'm obsessed and literally Can't Stop, Won't Stop, GameStop! ... Here's a 4Q20 model update to kick off 2021 as we start to gather up our popcorn for the ICR Conference festivities in just 10 days ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kknuk6/gme\_icr\_conference\_words\_matter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kknuk6/gme_icr_conference_words_matter/))

For those that have big brains and have been following along (here's the most recent one: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kh9na8/gme\_4q20\_financial\_model/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kh9na8/gme_4q20_financial_model/)), I have ticked almost every metric down, with the largest reduction being a 4k+ trim to daily order rate as January/post Christmas has started off rather weak. It's irrefutable that supply, whether through managerial operational failings, or lost market share, or outside their control due to Covid, is weighing on sales. Whenever there's been console supply especially the uptick in sales is notable and somewhat durable in the order rate data (many thanks once again GME Gang for the steady influx of [GameStop.com](https://GameStop.com) order #s!!! You retarded motherfuckers are going to singlehandedly pump the PowerUp Rewards loyalty numbers ðŸ˜‚  ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/km26gn/gamestop\_dd\_and\_potential\_profits/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/km26gn/gamestop_dd_and_potential_profits/))

With two full months of the quarter gone by I would note no one should have ever put their belief solely into one quarter making/breaking their thesis in isolation (unless you're talking about a biotech or some crazy shit. But this is a goddamn [GameStop.com](https://GameStop.com), FKA GameStop, we're talking about here.). The bears will vociferously argue otherwise. I look forward to hearing the gnashing of teeth of the dying animal that is Melvin Capital &amp; co. Let's make 'em bleed, boys.

My base case sits at $2/share, and will likely come down a touch more barring incremental console supply in January (in base case).

I think WSB is sleeping on a huge opportunity in Apple this month. Hereâ€™s why.,1609553867,WBuffettJr,300,"**TLDR:** Due to a confluence of factors (none of which are technical analysis), I believe a perfect storm is likely forming for a monster, historic ER occurring sometime in late January. The initial main factor for this was that COVID issues were causing a delay in the iPhone 12 launch, pushing it into to this quarter, but that led me to discover numerous other factors now making up my thesis. I believe not only will earnings grow, but the multiple could even expand. How to play it: calls dated end of Jan or mid Feb.    
    
# Analysis:    
Happy hangover day, fellow autists. I believe opportunities are rare to know when an ER is going to blow it out of the water by enough to overcome IV crush based on more than just a hunch, and when they occur once or twice per year you should swing big. When I play earnings releases, Iâ€™m almost always just a seller of spreads so that I can profit off of theta/IV crush surrounding the ER (theta gang always wins). This time however, Iâ€™ve bought outright calls. Here is what Iâ€™m seeing with Apple: 
    
## The iPhone 12 delay could mean huge YoY comparisons.    
What kicked all this off was that two months ago I realized we could be heading for huge numbers this quarter do to an atypical delay in the launch of the newest iPhone. Typically new iPhones are announced in mid-September with preorders beginning immediately and shipments beginning before the end of the month. However this year because of COIVD delays the launch date got pushed into October. The iPhone 12 preorders began mid-October with shipments a week later, and the iPhone 12 mini and Max began preorders November 6. And that means no sales of the new models counted in the quarter ended Sept. 30 (Appleâ€™s fiscal fourth quarter)as they usually do. This year all of those opening day sales have fallen into the upcoming fiscal Q1, setting up a potentially huge quarter in sales and making for easy YoY comparisons right out of the gate.  [Hereâ€™s a Fortune article on the delay of the launch.](https://fortune.com/2020/10/29/apple-q4-2020-earnings-delayed-iphone-12-sales/)    
    
## The â€œsuper cycleâ€ rumors appear to be true.    
As a lover of new tech, I always have to remind myself that the average person doesnâ€™t care about incremental new features as much as I do. So when I heard rumors earlier this year that Apple could be facing a â€œsuper cycleâ€ of upgrades due to 5G, I was skeptical. How much does the average person really care about spotty 5G service enough to jump on a new iPhone? But based on reports starting to come out, those rumors appear to be correct. Iâ€™ve seen a few articles suggesting a super cycle not seen since the iPhone 6.     
    
[Hereâ€™s a Yahoo Finance article on Wedbushâ€™s analysis](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wedbush-apple-aapl-iphone-12-141113883.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACvsQ8XuWl-EktMyc_0BOQkervx-N2812THmBzr26X8EZIBpNv2lmQ5FSlcToQD1EVRPC0q6byIRBL57FjX5kL4yCvJbv0rwaj4D16cz9J0QrnLFX9fVib7fRoDktDyMAWwBKhfTL_JRqy04wsJCzfTUD7Aw9ce6SkM21ZQOqbYO).   
    
Here are some notable quotes from that article since I know we donâ€™t read around here.    
&gt;""Based on our recent Asia checks we believe the supply chain is anticipating low to mid 90 million iPhone unit builds â€¦ **a roughly 35% increase from our original and Street forecasts**,"" says Ives, who covers AAPL stock for Wedbush.    
    
&gt;Compare that to the firm's expectations for iPhone 12 unit sales over time. Three months ago, Wedbush expected 65 million to 70 million unit builds for the December quarter; it raised its outlook to 75 million units in late October; and in mid-December, it set a ""stretch goal"" in the mid-80 million range.    
    
&gt;Wall Street broadly sees AAPL selling 217 million iPhones in the company's fiscal 2021, but Wedbush's bull case is ""north of 240 million units (250 million could be in the cards â€“ an eye popping figure)"" that would easily surpass the 231 million units the company sold in its fiscal 2015.    
    
&gt;**""We have not seen a launch uptrend such as this in a number of years for Apple and the only iPhone trajectory similar would be the iPhone 6 in 2014 based on our analysis.""**.   
    
[Here is an AppleInsider article, although it quotes the same research at Wedbush](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/15/apple-iphone-production-reports-corroborate-supercycle-thesis-analyst-says).   
Notable quote:    
&gt; That bump in production would represent a 30% year-over-year increase in smartphone models produced, **and is also well ahead of current Wall Street expectations**, Ives wrote.    
    
    
Itâ€™s anecdotal, but I personally skipped the iPhone 11 upgrade because I was perfectly content with my XS Max, however I did buy the 12 Pro Max.    
    
## The iPhone 12 sales mix:   
Itâ€™s not just that phone sales will be up on the iphone 12 launch, itâ€™s the mix within those sales. Typically when Apple launches phones they sell more of the of the entry level new phones than they do the premium, because the total addressable market is bigger. That doesnâ€™t appear to be the case this time. As early as September people were reporting that [Apple was making more higher end iPhone 12 models than entry-level handsets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-gets-price-target-hike-iphone-12-sales-mix) anticipating a shift in demand, and they appear to have been correct. Last year the entry level iPhone 11s outsold the premium iPhone 11s by a three to one margin. This year almost immediately after launch [people were reporting that the premium iPhone 12s were selling as much as the entry models.](https://investorplace.com/2020/10/greater-than-expected-iphone-12-demand-apple-aapl-stock-buy/) Since then, there have been reports trickling out that the premium iPhone 12s appear to actually be outselling the entry level versions.   
    
## Apple sold out of nearly everything they make for Christmas.
See further below for one of the reasons this may have happened, in both my â€œmacroâ€ and â€œrisksâ€ sections.    
    
    

Apple introduced a slough of new products from iMacs to watches this year, and they sold out of all of them. **The list of sold-out products at Christmas included the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max; iPad, iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad Mini; MacBook Air and Pro; iMac and iMac Pro; HomePod mini, and AirPods Max.** [Hereâ€™s a Barronâ€™s article mentioning the sell outs](https://www.barrons.com/articles/barrons-10-best-stocks-for-2021-51608337138).    

    
    
Apple wearables, I would argue, are now what economists call Veblen goods. These are unique products where the demand curve actually increases as the price increases. This can happen in goods such as wine, where the consumer lacks the knowledge in how to evaluate the product so they take pricing as a signal of quality. But another reason you can get that skewed demand curve is if the product conveys status. One example of this is sports cars. You can buy cars with 90% of the performance of the ultra top end cars for 30% of the price, but thatâ€™s not the point of owning them, is it? How often are you really out at the track? Lambo isnâ€™t in competition with $50k sports cars. They could raise the price $50k per car and people who can afford them would just want them more. Louis Vuitton bags and $50,000 Birkin purses are more examples. In fact with Birkin they not only constantly raise prices, they forbid people from buying them. You have to spend a lot of money on other lower tier products before youâ€™re â€œallowedâ€ to even buy a Birkin bag. This just makes new money women want them even more. 
   

Those are dramatic examples of course and Apple isnâ€™t behaving that way, but Apple just introduced very overpriced, new over-the-ear headphones which cost almost twice as much as the leading competitor, and yet...Apple sold out of every single color in the first two weeks and hit a three month waiting list by Christmas on a product that I would assume due to its high pricing has very fat margins. Apple charging twice as much makes them more appealing, not less, because wearables are worn and thus seen by your peers (and the opposite sex).   
    
## The Twitter rumor mill is reporting parts moving at a brisk pace
I canâ€™t track down the things Iâ€™ve read here and there on Twitter and Iâ€™m starting to run out of steam here, so you may have to do some searching on your own, but people who usually track movement of parts through the companies forming Appleâ€™s supply chain and normally have a good track record with their reports have reported that parts are moving through the chain at a very brisk pace. This is addressed some in the reports on the iPhone supply chain in my earlier links.    
    
## App sales are crushing it.   
Thanks probably in part to quarantine, app sales have been crushing it and [grew ~35% this December compared to ~17%](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/apple-alphabet-strong-christmas-sales) the prior year, meaning sales have grown at twice the pace.     

## Reoccurring revenue bundle numbers will be announced     
The biggest thing Iâ€™ve learned from 2020 is that nothing matters more to the market than the narrative surrounding the reoccurring revenue bundle...aka subscriptions. A company announces its cutting its dividend, but then tells you thatâ€™s because its going to pour all that money into boosting its subscriptions? The stock skyrockets. Look at Disney. AT&amp;T may be able to pull this off as well if it can convince people of that narrative with Warner/HBO max and cut its dividend to pour it into content, but thatâ€™s a big â€œifâ€ for them.    
    
Apple launched their new reoccurring revenue bundle this year. I personally signed up for the premium tier and now owe Apple $30 per month for the rest of my life. I was already paying them to backup my phone to the cloud, and now their bundle has thrown me into Apple Music, Apple TV+, etc. I am firmly entrenched in the Apple universe whether I like it or not.     
    
It is these reoccurring revenue numbers that offer the possibility of earnings multiple expansion.
    
# RISKS
**Are sellouts due to high demand, or due to COVID-related production problems?**    
I donâ€™t know.  Based on the reports Iâ€™ve read, some of which have been linked earlier in my post, it sounds like everything is running full speed in China and the supply chain is running at near or above a record clip. One possible risk is that this was not the case earlier this year and thus Apple sold out of things because they hadnâ€™t produced enough heading into Christmas. I personally believe that production may have taken a huge hit early in the calendar year, but by mid to late 2020 this was no longer a significant issue. I also believe that even if sales have taken a slight hit due to production, the market wouldnâ€™t really care. Markets are forward looking. They know COVID has impacted things globally, and even if Apple reports sales difficulties **they will be paired with significantly increased guidance for Q2**. [New reports have suggested that Apple has had to increase its iPhone production plans for 2021 by 20-30% because of strong demand}.(https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/15/strong-iphone-12-demand/) An announcement like that is not a recipe for a stock crash.     
    
    

**Macro factors causing a crash**.    
A lot of people around here appear to be scared of an impending crash. This seems to be based on the simple idea that stocks have run up a lot and therefore must crash. A reversion to the mean is imminent. I donâ€™t see it that way and I think the economy is more complex than that. Just because something has gone up a lot does not mean itâ€™s going to crash. People have been warning of a California real estate crash for 70 years.    
    

Iâ€™m a little bit older than you guys (by probably about 10-15 years) and I can remember the market frenzy of the dot.com boom. A lot of people were saying the same thing then, and while they were ultimately proven right, they were very early. I remember seeing another year to year and a half of enormous gains after hearing all those warnings. Of course the problem with musical chairs is that we never know when the music will stop, but I would argue if anything stocks are roughly fairly valued, not dangerously overvalued.    
    
As we go into 2021, we face the following conditions: a vaccine roll out that sometime between now and late â€˜21 will lead us into a v-shaped recovery. [The Krugman argument for this vision](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/opinion/joe-biden-economy.html), and [The Bloomberg argument for this vision](https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/opinion/articles/2020-12-01/get-ready-for-a-supercharged-economy). We also just had the Fed reaffirm 0% interest rates and the continuation of QE. Add to all of that very easy YoY earnings comps for the first two quarters of this year and this is not a recipe for a crash, itâ€™s a recipe for a steady market melt up. Where are the rich supposed to put all their money in a 0% interest rate environment? 0% pushes up the value of all asset classes, and this is especially true of real estate and stonks. Generally speaking, predicting macro economic movements is a losing game, but all of those things combined with the easy YoY comps means I donâ€™t feel the need to be concerned of an impending correction for at least the next two quarters. 
    
A much smaller factor but still a factor, I have seen it suggested that Apple will be among the larger beneficiaries of the stimulus checks going out, although those have not started rolling out until just now so that may have an impact on Q2 if any.

**Bad subscription numbers**    

If subscriptions to Apple One flopped, this could significantly overshadow sales and earnings numbers. I personally feel Apple isnâ€™t likely to seriously miscalculate predictions on a subscription bundle because they have their market dialed in, but I donâ€™t know that for sure. 

**Sales could have cratered in October**    

Sales often drop a little in the weeks preceding a phone launch. What if phone sales tanked during the delays waiting for an iPhone 12? That could be bad. Iâ€™m encouraged by the fact that iPhone 11 models appeared to still be having good sales numbers when the iPhone 12 was launched (see links earlier in this post), but I donâ€™t really know what October sales look like.

**COVID could have tanked all phone sales.**    

[This report says all phone activations generally tanked 23% on Christmas Day.](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/apple-iphones-dominate-christmas-day-activations) Two thoughts I have on that, that number is for all phone activations, not just iPhones. And two, thatâ€™s just for Christmas Day itself. There could be a wide array of reasons activations were down on that one day. To counter that, [this report says the iPhone was the best selling 5G phone](https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/21/best-selling-5g-phone/), even in October despite the phone not launching until the second half of that month. Additionally that article mentions pent up demand for 5G apple phones that sales are likely to be strong going forward.

##  Technical Analysis   
I donâ€™t believe in technical analysis. Charts donâ€™t know any of the things I just explained, and are therefore, in my opinion, useless to me. Maybe somebody has figured out a system for charts to predict the future, but I am not that person. 

## Fun rumors    
Iâ€™m not big on speculative rumors and momentum type plays, but if thatâ€™s your thing there are certainly rumors in the air. The most famous of which is the rumor that Apple is back to working seriously on an EV Car. Another is reports are just coming out in the last day or two that [Apple is seeing new successes in developing foldable tech.](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/31/two-foldable-iphones-reportedly-pass-tests/) Whether these things will impact the stock price isnâ€™t really my cup of tea, but if itâ€™s yours those are two things to consider. 

## Is my post an attempt at a WSB pump and dump?    
Iâ€™m under no allusions that my own WSB post is going to alter the trajectory of a $2.25 trillion company in any meaningful way.  That sort of thing may work on a post-IPO company that hasnâ€™t had its lockup expiration yet and thus has a tiny float (aka PLTR or numerous other recent â€œto the moonâ€ meme stocks) with limited float. (Thatâ€™s not to say those arenâ€™t great companies or great trades. Iâ€™m just sayinâ€™).


## My positions: 
Iâ€™m more conservative than most of WSB.  While I love this place with all my heart and love you guys for it, I believe risking it all to chase screenshot-worthy gains is moronic and not the path to building real, long-term wealth. Thus my positions are probably more conservative than youâ€™d expect.    
    
I have 20% of my net worth tied up in Apple via LEAPs. 9/16/2022 APPL $87.50 calls. I consider this to be essentially stock I hold for the long term. Delta is approaching 1 anyway so they practically are stock. Sometime in the depths of March I loaded up on FAANG LEAPs with the intention of actually holding them for years and then converting to shares. Those LEAPs were a little OTM at the time I bought them. I have no interest in day trading my significant LEAP positions so thatâ€™s going to sit there for the next two years.

But I also have put an additional 15% of my net worth into short term calls on Apple to play the ER. I have Feb 19 $130 calls which were about 10-15% OTM at the time I bought them. They are currently ITM. I also have 1/29 $135s and 1/29 $141s.     
    
This puts 35% of my net worth into Apple.

## How to get rich
I intend to cash out my short term calls after the ER, and I donâ€™t intend to reinvest or roll them out because I suspect Apple will be fully valued by then and there are better plays out there. I intend to keep my LEAPS because I bought those for the very long term and because at the very least I should hold them until March to hit the long term capital gains tax rate.    
    
I intend to take my profits from the calls and push them into shorting NNOX and XPEV, both of which have significant lockup expirations coming in mid to late February which I believe will significantly impact the stock prices in the short term. I have no interest in shorting XPEV right now, because you guys are crazy as fuck and for all I know EV stonks could all run up another 50% in the next month. Right about the time the Apple ER hits should be perfect.

## Criticism    
If you think Iâ€™m wrong, I would strongly encourage you to comment. I donâ€™t give a fuck about looking correct or saving face but I give many fucks about not losing money. If Iâ€™m wrong, I want to know it.

"Broke Short-Seller: ""Tesla is no longer â€œa growth storyâ€â€”itâ€™s a nearly-profitless stock promotion for idiots!""",1609557465,JasonColin,33," [https://www.valuewalk.com/teslas-figure-for-q4-deliveries-isnt-production-constrained/](https://www.valuewalk.com/teslas-figure-for-q4-deliveries-isnt-production-constrained/)

&gt;1. Tesla has no â€œmoatâ€ of any kind; i.e., nothing meaningfully proprietary in terms of electric car technology, while existing automakersâ€”*unlike* TeslaÂ­â€”have a decades-long â€œexperience moatâ€ of knowing how to mass-produce, distribute and service high-quality cars consistently and profitably, as well as the ability to subsidize losses on electric cars with profits from their conventional cars.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. Excluding sunsetting emission credit sales and adjusted for its fraudulently low warranty reserve (see below), in 2020 Tesla will again lose money, as it has every year in its 17-year existence.  
&gt;  
&gt;3. Unit demand for Teslaâ€™s cars is only increasing via continual price cutting.  
&gt;  
&gt;4. [Elon Musk is a pathological liar who under the terms of his SEC settlement cannot deny having committed securities fraud](https://www.plainsite.org/realitycheck/tsla.pdf).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; **Nothing is more amusing than seeing this giant stock promotion of a company try to perpetuate the illusion of being â€œsupply constrainedâ€ by continuing to add capacity (expanding its Chinese factory while breaking ground on new factories in Texas and Germany) in order to desperately try to maintain an image of â€œlimitless demandâ€ while it continually slashes prices just to utilize far less than its existing capacity. Teslaâ€™s â€œplanâ€ is now obvious: keep slashing prices to move as much volume as possible while using the worldâ€™s most illicitly creative accounting to maintain razor-thin profitability. But whatâ€™s the end game? If Tesla stops cutting prices volume will collapse. Tesla is no longer â€œa growth storyâ€â€”itâ€™s a nearly-profitless stock promotion for idiots!** 

Wooo, that's one man man who lost probably hundreds of thousands to millions betting against the inflated stock market supported by the printer, powell, and Tesla S&amp;P inclusion hype (before it got in).

He should have invested in literal Tesla shorts, and sold them back on the online market, he would have at least be in the green with some profit lol.

I mean, I suppose he's correct about the bubble, but the injections aren't going to end until around 2022 when the zero% interest rate suddenly improves for banks, bonds, and such, so sadly for him the riding keeps tiding! Those ""idiots"" he speaks of, like it or not, made 100x more money than most people in the market, including people on this sub!"

Something to feed your confirmation bias on Nio,1609560777,not_kathrine,97,"Nio's expansion to Europe has been discussed a lot. Many expressed doubts that Europeans would buy a Chinese car given all the negative stereotypes. From 2021, Germany introduced a CO2 tax (7c per liter) and till 2025 they give 9000 Euros for purchasing a EV. My main problem with German EVs is that they have an abysmal range. VW promises something up to 220km. I drove BMW i3 and whatever they promise there, the truth is that it's around 170 km and the charging takes like 9 hours. Why the hell do I need a car with such a range? 

Nio offers a range up to 900 km. Wow. That's something to consider. But what about the Chinese quality and as a potential German customer who got screwed over by the government's CO2 tax right on the New Year's day I decided to google what German reviews say on Nio:

ADAC praises Nio quality and price, specifying that 70% of materials are from renowned producers like Bosch

https://www.adac.de/rund-ums-fahrzeug/autokatalog/marken-modelle/auto/nio-es6/

Another very positive review stating that it has some problems with being adjusted to the European standards and market but in general it's a good car for German roads and is much cheaper than a comparable Audi

https://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/fahrbericht/nio-es6-guenstiger-elektro-suv/

Another generally positive review. They point out that the battery is not suitable for a speed of over 120km/h which is a big problem for Germany's autobahn as 120 km/h is the annoying grandma speed here. However, other European countries have a speed limit so it might be less of a problem

https://www.autobild.de/artikel/nio-es6-performance-2022-test-preis-deutschland-reichweite-technische-daten-elekrtro-suv-17098037.html

Tl;dr German reviewers praise Nio for its price, quality and driving experience. The main disadvantage is that it is not fulfilling for some Europe-specific demands. However, if Nio adapts to those requirements, it will be a recommendable car.

Tl;dr for retards: Nio at the European market ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€"

**Dec 17, 2020** \- Bill Ackman follows SpaceX on Twitter (For enthusiast of Yolo style DD)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/PSTH/comments/ke2jrx/bills\_just\_trying\_to\_troll\_us\_now/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSTH/comments/ke2jrx/bills_just_trying_to_troll_us_now/) 

**Analysis:**

In 2018 Musky needs $10 billion to complete Starlink's global constellation. By 2019 SpaceX had filed for 42,000 satellites but are accused of trying â€œto drown the ITU in studies so they can go ahead and operate Starlink under FCC sharing rules while ignoring the ITU first to file rulesâ€ ([https://twitter.com/TMFAssociates/status/1183436364974419968](https://twitter.com/TMFAssociates/status/1183436364974419968)) At this point I believe that funding methods were being discussed and the possibility of a Starlink spin off was proposed. 

February 6, SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell expresses this sentiment at the JP Morgan event. I think it was still only speculative and Musk would basically refute this March 9 at the Satellite 2020 conference saying he was thinking about it â€œzeroâ€. In August SpaceX reported raising $1.9 billion in private funding. This plus funding series J though M equals around $3.2 billion.([https://craft.co/spacex/funding-rounds](https://craft.co/spacex/funding-rounds)) 

By the end of September Musk tweeted ""We will probably IPO Starlink, but only several years in the future when revenue growth is smooth &amp; predictableâ€ and that â€œIâ€™m a huge fan of small retail investors. Will make sure they get top priority. You can hold me to it.""

Did something occur between March and September that changed zero to probably? Bill Ackmanâ€™s SPAC Pershing Square Tontine Holdings (PSTH) IPOs July 22. A blank check company with $5-7 billion to spend, specific acquisition requirements, and marketed as â€œthe most investor friendly SPAC in the world.â€ Despite no announced target, there are substantial investments by Guggenheim, Baupost, Soroban, etc. ([https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=PSTH&amp;subView=institutional](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=PSTH&amp;subView=institutional))

In October, Momentus announced it will go public through a reverse merger with Stable Road. Their partnership with SpaceX and backing by Prime Movers Lab establishes a tenuous connection between Musk and Ackman as well as aligning interests.

In December, after reports that SpaceX was seeking funding to double its valuation to $92 billion, Musk coyly responds â€œIncorrect.â€ The following day u/Mobiledead posts a screenshot of Bill Ackman following SpaceX on Twitter. 

When I read the PSTH=SpaceX speculation I wrote it off as being as likely as Subway or Pornhub. But when I looked into the timeline of the various threads, there were some stars that seemed to align for Starlink. Bill Ackman was offering the right amount to help complete Starlinkâ€™s constellation. The $5-7 billion could fit the 10-20% minority share he intended to acquire with the SPAC depending on how much of SpaceX's valuation is derived from Starlink. Ackman would take the largest SPAC to date and bring internet connection to the entire world cementing his legacy as an investor and an activist. Musk would be able to stop funneling money from his true passion with SpaceX, the Mars mission. And most importantly even small retail investors would see astronomical returns. 

The main argument against Starlink, in my opinion, is Muskâ€™s prediction of an IPO several years in the future and his tweet cautioning investors about SPACs. ([https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1329483695493931009](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1329483695493931009)) My counterargument: He says a lot of shit on Twitter. Although Starlink does not fit every acquisition criteria, we know Ackman was in talks with AirBnB at one point and they are missing some of the acquisition criteria as well. I don't think that Starlink is the most likely candidate for PSTH but I no longer think that it is entirely impossible. This is purely speculation and I'm sure there are things I've missed. If there's something I'm misunderstanding feel free to correct me.

**ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS MORE â€œARTIFICALâ€ THAN â€œINTELLIGENTâ€**

As has been dutifully noted by many fellow autists, Palantir is an artificial intelligence/algorithim data mangement software company. However, you donâ€™t quite have to worry about your wife going off and getting a robot boyfriend anytime soon. While this may come to a surprise to Jeffery Epsteinâ€™s pal Steve Hawking[who believed robots will soon take over the world](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newsweek.com/stephen-hawking-named-epstein-unsealed-files-virginia-giuffre-ghislaine-maxwell-1521920%3famp=1)  smart people in the field have been dealing with solving the problems of making artificial intelligence work for decades. This is good news for all those that have diamond hands ðŸ’ŽðŸ‘ on their Palantir shares in the coming years, because one of the founders solved one of the major problems over a decade ago and Iâ€™ll tell you how.


**The problem with Artificial Intelligence and the Palantir Solution**


If you arenâ€™t yet familiar with [Stephen Cohen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Cohen_(entrepreneur)) you should be. This is the ultimate autist chad that coded the first prototype of Palantir in 8 weeks. At his time at Stanford, he studied machine learning and artifical intelligence (this was way back in 2005, these beasts of nature are always 20~ years ahead of the normie media and their trends). However, as Cohen himself mentions in his talk at Stanford [â€œThe Path to Palantirâ€](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g_6_kGDdjwI) he became dissapointed studying AI due to the many limitations of the field he quickly realized. Firstly, the AI is only ever as smart as the algorithms that the humans were able to develop, thus more â€œartificialâ€ than â€œintelligent.â€ Secondly, while computers are able to store and calculate numbers even faster than an autist doing his math homework before his mom will let him have his tendies, and their superior skill at storing this information, computers cannot grasp numerous concepts that humanâ€™s are skilled at. Most fundamentally, this is creativity and anything that is subjective. The example Cohen uses in his speech is hunger. Try explaining the feeling of hunger to someone and while you may be able to quantify it as a number between 1-10, this quantification leaves a lot out that someone that has never experienced hunger would understand. To put it simply, there are numerous factors in life that are impossible for a computer to qualify. Computers are good at factors they can quantify (numbers) but are as retarded as your average WSB bottom feeder when it comes to the qualitative (subjective). This is where Palantir comes in. Effectively, Palantir solves the quantitative issues for the human and lays it out for humans to interact with and add in qualitative analysis. Palantir is a marriage between a computerâ€™s impeccable ability to process and store numbers and data and humans impeccable ability to use creativity and view context as well as the subjective. 


**Software &amp; Business: The Dinosaur Superstructure**


Heres where our other founder bellwether [Peter Thiel ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel) comes in. If you havenâ€™t heard of him yet, your girlfriend probably doesnâ€™t you stay out past 8 PM, even when sheâ€™s not home. Member of the paypal mafia, when hes not busy making billions with his buddies musk and bezos, heâ€™s [taking down Gawker with Hulk Hogan ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/06/21/peter-thiels-war-on-gawker-a-timeline/?sh=78387f3251c5)for outing his private sex life. Like how Cohenknows how computerâ€™s work, Thiel knows how businesses work. How many people here have been in an actual office building? Probably not the right crowd, I know, most of you still live in your parentâ€™s basement, but that wonâ€™t matter when PLTR moons. Anyway, one of the first things youll notice is that the majority of technology used by businesses and governments are older than the average /r/teenagers poster. [According to research conducted by Kaspersky, â€œfour in ten of very small businesses (VSB), and roughly half of small and medium-sized businesses (SMB), still rely on operating systems such as Windows XP or Windows 7 which are nearing their end of life.â€](https://www.itproportal.com/amp/news/businesses-still-dependent-on-outdated-software/) For some reason, I cannot find similar statistics for even larger companies that would be more likely for Palantir to be working with, but iâ€™d wager from experience and knowing the scaleability issues that come with updating to technology, especially when dealing with a bunch of boomers, that it would be even higher for large companies. However, this is great news, because our good friend Thiel has the perfect formula to grab the biggest 6000 businesses by the balls.


Essentially, Palantir fronts the costs of installing and getting the software embedded into an operation in itâ€™s â€œacquisition contractâ€ stage. Im not a finance frog, but from what I understand they donâ€™t actually make money from these contracts. Hence why they havenâ€™t been profitable. However, the model is like a snowball. After the acquisition contract has expired, the boomers running the operation Palantir is contracting to have finally figured out how to use the software without training wheels and it is entrenched in their companies business. A larger contract with higher margins is signed. Further, companies of that companies competition look at what Palantir has done for that company, such as when in Q3 Palantir found 315m in unnecessary spending for an oil and gas company, slotting to save the company 1b in the coming 12 months https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx and they are forced to sign an acquisition contract, further pushing the snowball along and acting as a case study of success for Palantir. 


Remember to diamond hands and buy that dip. The markets are an unmedicated bipolar teenaged girl on her period and currently Palantir is in a downswing, but that is only a buying opportunity for the wise of us. Short term, I could see Palantir dipping as low as $20. This negative feedback loop will be broken either by a new contract, Karp interview day, another media announcement, or demo day. Eventually. Iâ€™ll lose a lot of you here, if I already havent, but hold strong and donâ€™t stress the short term as long as you agree with my thesis and have done/seen enough due diligence of your own to understand the fundamentals of this company are as solid as Karpâ€™s skiing legs. Longer term, I can see this company being at 100b+ market cap being conservative.

Is Moderna currently undervalued?,1609572119,RexSueciae,29,"Let me start out by saying that whenever someone like the Motley Fool puts out an article about why this stock or that stock is a sure thing / is not recommended / is a dumpster fire, I have the urge to do the opposite of their recommendations out of sheer spite. And, indeed, those guys put out an [article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/22/why-moderna-stock-plunged-today/) wondering why MRNA took a dive about a week ago. No firm conclusions from them, other than the fact that Moderna isn't on their list of the top ten best stocks which might have been drawn up by a haruspex for all I know.

Anyways.

I'm serious when I say that I think Moderna is undervalued. And I don't have any financial interests in this post, either. Mostly I'm trying to psych myself up because, hey, maybe I'm not talking nonsense. Their stock price just looks absolutely bonkers.

Everyone who bought Moderna at its peak a month ago has been keeping up with the news. No doubt most of you have been watching red numbers in horror. (I'm sure there's at least one bear who's sitting nicely on some puts, but I don't know how many people put their money down on what would've been a very risky wager. It can't be zero.) Moderna got its emergency use authorization from the FDA awhile back; they're not the only company with a COVID vaccine, though, and the headlines for Moderna since then have been pretty bad (in comparison with, say, Pfizer). Many vaccines have side effects, but then you hear about the fact that [side effects with the Moderna vaccine are super common for people with dermal implants](https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/moderna-vaccine-facial-filler), and every now and then you'll see an article about [some frontline worker getting hospitalized after their Moderna-powered vaccination](https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2020/12/moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-triggers-severe-allergic-reaction-in-wallowa-county-health-care-worker-officials-say.html) (there's more than one example, that's just the most recent). And the investors are panicking.

Investors, of course, are stupid sheep, because this stuff is nothing new. Remember back in 1976 when [an outbreak of the swine flu caused the Ford administration to push through a vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_swine_flu_outbreak), then some people who got the vaccine ended up with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, ironically causing people to freak out even more? You know how many people actually suffered serious side effects? A few hundred. Out of literally millions -- about 25% of the US population, including President Ford himself, received the vaccine. What happened was basically the worst-case scenario and the chances of any single person getting their nervous system mangled was still infinitesimal. You'd literally have a better chance of being struck by lightning. (Lightning, for what it's worth, doesn't usually kill, either.)

Yeah, maybe people who have had cosmetic surgery recently should be careful with the Moderna vaccine. That's nothing. Most people will need to wait their turn anyways, as healthcare workers will largely continue to get the first doses. I don't know if the majority of Americans will have a chance at vaccination before the end of the coming year. For every scaremongering news article reporting on (relatively uncommon) side effects, you get a bunch of other articles about how, say, [Moderna's vaccine was just used to vaccinate a senior living facility](https://katv.com/news/local/moderna-vaccine-administered-at-little-rock-senior-living-facility). (I have no idea about the ratio -- can't be bothered to do the math -- but you should also keep in the mind the old adage of ""if it bleeds, it leads."") Hell, the biggest risk associated with Moderna's vaccine is probably wastage from negligence or malice, [like what happened with that pharmacist in Wisconsin](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/31/952536531/pharmacist-arrested-accused-of-destroying-more-than-500-moderna-vaccine-doses). Dude straight-up destroyed 550 doses. Big yikes, as the kids say.

I feel like if I don't watch myself I'll veer off into a tangent about vaccine safety in general and other fun topics that're suited for a good ramble. The main point is this: Moderna's still putting out vaccines. They finished Phase 3 trials very, very recently. The verdict? [It works](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/moderna-announces-publication-results-pivotal-142200437.html). If you get COVID you could get seriously fucked up, as the poor souls in the placebo group cofirmed, and the people in the vaccine group all lived. Oh, yeah, and the Department of Defense is buying up doses under some cushy government contract. That probably means something.

Maybe it's just my gut that says a company which has put out a viable COVID vaccine shouldn't have its stock continue to tank indefinitely. The trend line of MRNA prices has been steadily [down since early December](https://i.imgur.com/xSLwIJM.png). In the last few days, though, I think I see the barest [hint of an inflection point](https://i.imgur.com/8tb2XQp.png). In the [past day, even](https://i.imgur.com/z2fIQT1.png).

Or maybe I'm seeing things and it'll continue to slide. If you think that I'm wrong, go ahead and take out a whole bunch of puts, see if you're not too late to pull in a profit. I don't care. I just hope fewer people will be dying from COVID from now on.

I have been a bull in the RV market for a long time. I first bought nio at 1.60 per share. However, I currently believe that Tesla stock is extremely overpriced.

Looking 10 years in to the future, I believe Tesla is going to dominate Ev market. Their future revenue are going to be diversified and stable. The problems is the stock price  today is based on earnings from 2030. That means the stock price is going to be around the same level as today 10 years from now. I donâ€™t t believe investors will be willing to hold on to an  investment thatâ€™s high risk for little reward. 

The second the ev fewer slows down, the stock will have a massive correction and recover at a rate that match earnings. 

The way I am looking at Tesla is as if everyone in 2000 knew apple will pass two trillion in market cap by 2018.  Of course every one will buy in until apple reach a valuation of 2 trillion. However, people who bought at 2 trillion arenâ€™t going to hold for 20 years for 40% gain. There would be a massive sell off. The same thing is going to happen to Tesla. The people who bought at peak price arenâ€™t going to hold for 10 years just for the price to the share to be justified.

The Dummy's guide to trading the Georgia Senate Runoff,1609578399,dragom7,137,"**TLDR: If you are pretty sure about what the trajectory of the Georgia Senate Runoffs will be, you can make money. Scroll to the bottom for the plays (for each outcome)**

**Introduction:**  
Almost everyone on this sub knows QQQ. Now, recall the price action around Nov. 3 (or if you can't because you're that guy from the movie Memento, pull out your Robinhood app and follow along with me kid).  

On the eve of the general election, when the so-called pollsters said it would be a Democratic sweep, QQQ sat at $269. The next day, with the election contested, QQQ rocketed to $294. It remained steady on Friday, before declining the next week.  

Why did the election affect the price the way that it did? Well, it's because Biden's legislative agenda depends on Democratic control of Congress. In particular, he can raise corporate taxes with just a simple majority in the Senate.  

The institutional whales (the folks who actually move markets) believe that:
- Companies that benefitted bigly from Trump's tax cuts (tech companies especially) will be hurt by Biden raising taxes.
- Companies that would benefit from fiscal stimulus (green new deal, infrastructure) will be helped by by Biden's plans, and even more if Biden controls Congress.  
- Regardless of who controls the Senate, the divided nature means some companies are guaranteed to benefit.

Don't take my word for it. Read this report from Goldman Sachs (p.15-16): https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/beyond-2020-post-election-policies-f/report.pdf   

Originally, tech companies (facing more regulation and tax increases under the Democratic Trifecta) was trending down. But then, when it became clear the Republicans would hold the Senate and taxes weren't going up, tech stocks soared. Yet, suddenly, there was a small blip downward the next week. Why? Because David Perdue (R) was headed to a runoff, injecting the possibility that Democrats still had a chance to control Congress.  

**Which stocks are impacted, and why**

If Democrats gain control of the U.S. Senate, that means Biden can pass his legislation.
- Some companies will be helped bigly (e.g. Renewables)
- Some companies may be hurt (more taxes) but also helped (more fiscal spending)
- Some companies may be hurt bigly (more taxes, regs, and less gov't subsidies)


To make this a pure election-related play, we want to trade:
- companies that benefit bigly from Democratic legislation (and don't have short-term non-political risk)
- companies that are hurt bigly from Democratic legislation (and don't have short-term non-political risk)

So what companies benefitted the most from Trump's tax cuts? (Source: Goldman Sachs Client note)  
- Tech companies like Netflix, which saw its effective tax rate go from 23% to 7%.
- Railroad companies like CSX, which saw its effective tax rate go from 37% to 23%.
- Healthcare companies like HCA, which saw its effective tax rate go from 32% to 20%.
- Pure financial companies like CME, saw its effective tax rate go from 36% to 23%.

Obviously, pandemic-related questions muddle price-action on healthcare. At the same time, there is still some policy uncertainty to what will happen to railroads regardless of the outcome of the runoffs (they will have higher taxes, but that may be offset by stimulus/infrastructure spending). That leaves two sectors as our pure election plays:
- Tech companies will get more regulation and higher taxes if Biden takes Senate
- Financials will get more regulation and higher taxes if Biden takes Senate

Out of those sectors, specific companies may be overvalued or undervalued, and other concerns may matter more than legislative impact by the U.S Congress. For example, BABA is a tech company in QQQ, but as a Chinese company it sure isn't going to impacted much by U.S. tax legislation. We can just ignore it.

However, a U.S. company like NFLX which is a bit overpriced and very exposed to a tax-cut rollback, is an excellent bear trade for a Democratic Senate scenario (especially if corporate tax increases start being mentioned). While MSFT, which is slightly under-valued and also exposed to tax increases, may be a good trade against a Democratic Senate.  


Information about the races to consider:
- In the November General election:
	- Perdue (R) won 49.7 percent of the vote, while Ossoff (D) won 47.9 percent. In other words, Ossoff substantially underperformed Biden.
	- The Republican candidates (Loeffer + Collins) won a combined 49.4 percent, while the Democratic candidates (Warnock et al) won a combined 48.4 percent.
	- These are both substantial leads for the Republicans.
- The ""reputable"" polls:
	- Republican-leaning Trafalgar Group (""most accurate pollster of 2016""), which had Trump up 3-4% in its November poll (i.e. 3-4% wrong), has now pegged both the Democratic candidates leading slightly in its late December poll.
	- Democratic-leaning Survey-USA (which has pretty accurate polling) had Biden up 1-2% in its last general election poll, is now predicting a Democratic sweep in its late December poll
	- Poll to Watch: AJC/UGA, with polling by UGA Professor Trey Hood (the most accurate major poll this year for Georgia). This will be released soon.
- The Rev. Raphael Warnock is currently in divorce proceedings, and was recently accused by his wife of running over her foot with his car. Watch for whether this gains any traction (or at least enough to sway swing voters)


The plays:
- If you expect both Democratic Senate candidates to sweep (both 2%+), then AGGRESSIVELY short QQQ, NFLX, CME, and long green energy + industrials (e.g. etfs like TAN and Solar stocks like ENPH). I would buy weekly Jan. 8 FD puts.
- If you expect both Democratic Senate candidates to win with a significant margin (both 0.5%+), short QQQ, NFLX, CME. I would buy puts for Jan. 15/22, since the counting might drag on a few days.
- If you expect Republicans to comfortably hold at least one seat, long QQQ (specifically NFLX, FB, and MSFT) for Jan. 15
- If you expect Republicans to sweep, long QQQ and short green energy for Jan. 15.
- If you expect it to be unclear whether Republicans can hold at least one seat (think month-long recount), long vega on QQQ &amp; NFLX with a bearish tilt. This would be a short vertical call spread, or buying a medium-term strangle. 
- If you expect Trump to still be President on Jan 22 following the events of Jan. 6, aggressively short SPY and long MAGA because a civil war is probably coming."

Just letting you know the bullshit behind clean energy: be long on big oil,1609582690,bragghy,189,"*DISCALIMER: If you want to learn about this in more depth and want to verify my claims, this is a link of a TED conference from a seasoned enviromentalist who explains these issues in details (*[*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-yALPEpV4w*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-yALPEpV4w)*), but for the purpose of wsb, I will keep this post nice and short and focus on what really matters: money. Also english is not my native language, so forgive any errors*

In the last few years there's been a lot of speculation around the shift to renewables. A lot of people are bullish on solar, wind an EVs and are very bearish on big oil companies. I'm going to explain to you why **the government(s) shift to ""clean energy"" and the recent oil crisis  is actually very bullish for big oil in the medium to long term**.

# Renewables cannot exist without oil

Basically as it turns out, **current tech for solar and wind sucks big time**, and it probably will for decades to come. Not only they are nowhere near as enviromentally sustainable as nuclear power (because they need lots of terrain,  use 20x more resources than nuclear fission power plants, and there are recycling issues), but most importantly, these green plants depend on the sun shining and the wind blowing, so **they can only run and produce energy about 30% of the time.** The key here is that there is no real efficient way (no, pumping and dumping water is not efficient) to have these plants running without coupling them with fossil fuel burning regular plants, beacuse otherwise the electric power grid would be a mess. **So the real reason that all these oil companies are fine with the government shifting to green energy is that, to run this utopia of solar panels, wind turbines, and EVs, you'll still need their oil**. In fact, these companies are the ones that are lobbying politicians (in particular democrats, in the US case), persuading it to pursue this ""green"" bullshit instead of going with real less harmful choice, which is regular old nuclear energy. 

# The 2020 oil price shock benefits BIG oil companies in the long run

The oil price disaster in march might cause a short term problem with oil companies, but **BIG oil companies rubbed their hands**. Maybe the small oil companies or the ones with lots of debt can face problems and go out of business, but **the GIANT with a healthy balance sheet can survive the crisis and have even more market share**. You have to think about this as if oil companies were coffee shops. During corona, many closed and never opened again becaus eof bankrupcty, so the ones that had lots of cash available before the big hit, the big players like Starbucks, will benefit when there is full or partail reopening of the economy.

# Oil demand will not shrink that much

If people knew that **oil is not just used for powering engines**, they probably wouldn't have such a negative outlook on oil demand. Guys, oil is fucking used to build anything that is made out of **plastic**. Even to make some **medications** you need stuff that comes from oil. To get all the useless shit that the west buys from India and China, you'll still need oil to power **container ships** that sail the ocean. Once this corona shit is over, people will still buy plane tickets to go on vacation. Sure, maybe business trips will take a permanent hit and there be slightly less demand due to the transition to ""green"", BUT, as we said earlier, green still needs it .... and we are still not adressing the elephant in the room: there are massive **emerging markets economies** growing in the worild today, a lot of second and third world countries that will still rely on oil for their initial growth for decades. These countries will offset the loss of demand from developed nations. Shit, general commodities prices have been skyrocketing recently. You wanna jump on steel gang and not on oil gang? The only way oil prices fall from here is if OPEC shits the bed.

# The play

As long as this obsession for and complete ignorance and denial on how to solve climate change continues, and as long as the goverments of the west are corrupt and cannot see that they need to boost nuclear power and public transportation instead of solar, wind and EVs, big oil companies with a heathy balance sheet will be fine in the next decade. **Many oil companies are trading at or below book value, with massive dividend yields**, it won't stay like this forever. Do yourself a favour and be long on **RDS, XOM, BP, TOT, CVX and maybe even the italian E**. Saw a lot of hedge funds buying **OXY** in the past few months for some reason. Either buy shares, and if you are a brave man use leverage. I wouldn't advise options on this one since we don't know when the catalyst for the rally will come, and one of the main points of the play is to get that juicy dividend. If you just need to use options, use LEAPS for the love of god. I expect a return of AT LEAST 20% on teh shares alone, maybe even a lot more.

**TLDR: shift to solar and wind will actually benefit supermassive oil companies with healthy balance sheets that can weather the current crisis**"

GME Price Targets for 2021 ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ (According to the Short Float Data) ðŸš€,1609587670,ShortTheNasdaq,263,"ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ GME GANG CHECKING IN. ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ 

Dear GME gang ðŸš€,

I wanted to share my Price Targets (PT) for GME but no BS here. I give you my PT according to actual facts.

Letâ€™s take a look at the table and check when the short % of free float went from a high point (\~160%) at around February 2020 to a low point (\~140%) - which by the way are in absolute terms both huge numbers.

*Processing img zojf6rxwnw861...*

The stock went up \~94% **BUT** most of the gain took place at 2 key moments: at the recovery of the market crash and then in late August which shows that ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ-ing is key to capture most of the gains. Why do I say this? Because when holding the stock you could â€œfeelâ€ like you bled when you watch the stats:

*Positive daily returns:          49.3%*  
*Negative daily returns:         50.7%*

BUT IT WAS IN FACT THE SHORT SELLERS WHO BLED HARD. CHECK THIS OUT:

*Best daily return:                   23.0 %*  
*Worst daily return:                -13.7 %*

Imagine you sold GME when the -13.7% happened. You would not have captured the 94% returns. So just ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ and let those shorts go bankrupt.

Okay, here I showed **FACTS**. Stuff that actually happened. Here is **my opinion about a reasonable price target** now according to the data.

I think we could **easily** hit +80% returns over the next 6 months when the short % of free float will return to 140% it makes **a lower bound PT of $34 without a short-squeeze**. But this doesnâ€™t even account for the fact that some short positions could not be able to hold from here. Keep in mind that some short-sellers have a triple-digit drawdown already.

# Conclusion

**Price targets for the 6-12 next months according to the data from 2019-2020** :

* Conservative:  $34 without a short-squeeze (+80%) 
* Likely to happen: $50 without a short-squeeze (+180%)
* Optimist:  $70 without a short-squeeze (+372%)

Note that these are price targets if the short % of free float go down to \~140% the price could go up substantially more. AND I didnâ€™t even account for the fact that Ryan Cohenâ€™s stake is now at 12.9%. 

I will be honest here, with a short-squeeze I have actually no idea where this could go but again very easily $100.

**I WILL PUBLISH THE ULTIMATE DD ON GME TOMORROW BE SURE TO CHECK THIS OUT (NO BS IN HERE).**

**Positions**: a lot of shares."

Any actually experiences at a Gamestop location recently?,1609592340,dukeofmuffinz,8,"Everyone is all over GME in this sub lately, including my self BB ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€!!!!  But with that being said has anyone actually been to a gamestop store recently?

I cant really read or do actual dd so I decided to do my own retarded evaluation by spending dat $600 stimulus check at a gamestop store today to get my own in person evaluation and let me tell you it was amazing!

It's been a rainy boring dystopia lately and this morning I saw my stimulus check hitting my account.  I've always wanted a Nintendo switch so I could play zelda and Mario games again so naturally I drove to the nearest Gamestop to immediately spend all of my money.  

Upon arrival i saw a sign on the door stating that they had a new trade in system and they would buy any games or gaming system from you (I have an old PS4 I  use to play while my girlfriend was away hanging out with her other guy friends).  I asked the employee what they would give for a PS4 and he told me they would give me 100 dollars cash or 150 dollars in store credit!  The old gamestop probably would have given me 5 bucks and a stick of gum but the new one gamestop is looking out for you.

I bought my switch and the games and signed up for a pro account because someone on here told me to do that and I follow you guys blindly because I'm stupid.

All in all it was a lovely experience and when the next quarter reports are disclosed note that 450 dollars of there earnings are from my stimmy money!

Gamestop is a bad idea,1609593702,Cato022,14,"Common guys wake up GME was a bad investment the company has no future. I mean they sell PHYSICAL video games, wich you often can get much cheaper on G2A or other keysellers, the thing that is mainly still keeping them afloat are the pop! figurines and the merch but not everyone is buying their merchandise and therefore its the lesser part of their profit. Many prefer just to play the games, wich you also can buy online cheaper and also there are games you can just buy online,so there is not really a future for them something that manifests in their willingness, to sell you subscriptions. The company might retain their business in some places but will probably decline and so will the share price. They also have an overall bad reputation in the gaming community from badly refurbished consoles, to aggressive subscription selling to screwing over the customer. They just sell mainly triple A titles that  you can get cheaper on the internet. They need to maintain their stores wich a keyseller must not and they are vulnerable to  covid lockdowns. So do yourselves a favor and sell the shares at the next time they go up. And if you look for something where you will get much money from buy Games Workshop shares because they have a functional online store a business model and a fan community that will buy whatever overpriced stuff they put out, they also have a product that just they can sell and according to their shareholder conference big expansion plans."

1. Huge EV+ risk that is largely uncorrelated to market risk (short squeeze).  Even low probability of outcome makes more effort and capital worth it.  Piling on the trade actually increases its likelihood.
2. Fundamentals and activist investor (Cohen) give, at minimum, a plausible semi-bluff on turnaround.  May make errors but error will not be Blockbuster one.
3. Chart technicals are incredible.  5x move but still largely invisible except to /wsb.  1.35B market cap gives face validity to 10x return even with move that already happened.   
4. Perception of silliness and dismissal around threat have made short sellers prone to errors and more likely to pay off big.

For poker folks, it reminds me of holding a big flush draw.    It may not come through, but the possibility allows us to bet aggressively and potentially take the pot even without the hand.  If it hits, we can potentially entice our opponent to pay off big later.   Plus our opponent doesn't take us seriously, increasing their chance of overvaluing their ability to bluff us out."

Solar spot discussion and what does it mean for the financial market?

As we all know, the sun controls our lives and financial markets. Recently we have passed the halfway point of the solar activity trough. Because of this, I am predicating that SPY will reach 430 dollars by the end of 2021, as we leave the bearish cycle of the sun and enter the hyper sunshin bullrun. These are fundamentals, since the sun is a fundamental indication of our financials. -- yes I am not a fucking notradomeass for predicting stocks go up. Also made username in 2019.

CRSR DD - Discounted stock! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€,1609604946,Age_Specialist,91,"Hi fellow retards and autists,

It is time to quit lurking and give you a DD of my own: CRSR - Corsair Gaming, Inc.

This will be a long read, but fear not I will post a TL;DR section at the end.

Lets start off with something more trivial, but important nonetheless.

1) Management: Maybe you do not know the site â€œOwlerâ€ but one of itâ€™s features is that members of the website can rank CEOs. Andrew Paul (Corsairâ€™s CEO) has a rating of 92/100. Apart from Andrew the team consists of people believing in the brand and having proven to be successful. Read up on them https://www.corsair.com/us/en/team


2) Market sentiment: It seems people have generally gotten scared last couple of days and letting their hands turn into paper. If you have any position in CRSR, keep it. If not itâ€™s a great time to buy. Although it would seem there is a bearish sentiment on the stock there actually isnâ€™t. Thanks to /u/maxfort86 for making a handy tool for checking options (seems to be down though at the moment) we can see there are actually a lot more call options than puts telling us the sentiment is bullish. Apart from options we can also turn to the general analyst price target on finance.yahoo being a $40,11. It also enjoys a Zacks rank of 1 - Strong buy.
Heck even /u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT became a millionaire with the stock and loaded back in 5 days ago and although some people think he dumped, Iâ€™m pretty sure heâ€™s going to ride it with me to a PT of $55-$60 unless it rockets hard and well than weâ€™ll just strap in for more %.
So even if it follows conservative analysts you can make over 10% in a pretty short term without actually making full on retarded plays.


3) Earnings date: They crushed their last earning report and nothing tells us the next one is going to be different. It is estimated that they will report earnings feb 09, 2021. The moment they will report their earnings you know this sucker is gonna soar. They almost doubled their previous consesus EPS and the way things are going I believe they will beat it again easily since the next consesus EPS is still lower then the realised one for Q3 and as I said nothing really changed or will change by then. Corona still got a lot of people at home and more and more people are buying equipment for pcs and also breaking them through more (sometimes abusive) usage. More sales = more profit = stonk go up.


4) Confirmation bias: Who doesnâ€™t love hearing they are right? Well everything is screaming that CRSR is going to make moves, yes it is discounted now and heck maybe itâ€™ll discount a little further a maximum of 10%, but the reward surely outweighs the risk on this one. Everyone is saying this is a must buy and will rise back sooner than later. Just look at finance.yahoo or zacks like I mentioned or any other of the gazilion sites that exist. None of them are saying this stock isnâ€™t going to go up, the contrary is very much true in this case.


Disclaimer: I am not a professional or financial adviser, if you want to buy the stock because of the DD it is at your own risk. These are my convictions not a sure prediction of the market.


Positions: 488 stocks @ 37,39, donâ€™t dabble in options.


TL;DR; buy stonk, make money. Hold longer, make more money ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€"

# **Politics will be front and center as a catalyst in the first week of the new year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/politics-will-be-front-and-center-as-a-catalyst-in-the-first-week-of-the-new-year-.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind, but already in the dawn of the new year, the market could face its first big challenge.
*****
&gt; The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday, when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.
*****
&gt; With President-elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate.
*****
&gt; The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats. But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win, each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.
*****
&gt; â€œGeorgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years,â€ said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. â€œItâ€™s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.â€
*****
&gt; Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff, while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.
*****
&gt; â€œItâ€™s a binary event,â€ said Mills, adding itâ€™s of growing interest to markets. â€œThe general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent, the 2018 election has humbled us â€¦ The Senate outcomes, in particular, seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.â€
*****
&gt; Mills said the results may take several days to determine, adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey, 88% expect Republicans to maintain control, and most say that is a positive for the stock market.
*****
&gt; â€œThe market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats,â€ said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.
*****
&gt; â€œThat totally dominates [trading] because itâ€™s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes,â€ Boockvar said. â€œI think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spendingâ€ by Democrats.
*****
&gt; # By the numbers
&gt; A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks, as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&amp;P 500 was up 16.3% for the year, ending at 3,756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year, followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year, and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12,888.
*****
&gt; Besides the runoff vote, the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week, including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100,000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245,000 jobs created in November.
*****
&gt; There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday, and a number of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.
*****
&gt; The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.
*****
&gt; Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed, and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow, and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trumpâ€™s task force.
*****
&gt; In that recent RBC survey, three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. â€œWe suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met,â€ RBC strategists wrote.
*****
&gt; They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.
*****
&gt; â€œThis suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point, it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night, closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery,â€ the strategists noted.
*****
&gt; Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Bidenâ€™s presidency.
*****
&gt; However, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley says he will challenge the certification, and several House Republicans have already vowed to contest the election at that time. If one House member and a senator jointly object to a stateâ€™s slate of electors, the two houses of Congress must separately debate and vote on the objection.
*****
&gt; Strategists see little chance of any impact on the election outcome, but there could be fireworks. Trump has been claiming since the election that there was fraud but multiple courts failed to find any truth to the claims.
*****
&gt; Rupkey said investors are not taking into account enough potential for political risk from the deep animosity between the two political parties.
*****
&gt; â€œI think the additional stimulus and hopes for additional stimulus, and infrastructure spending in 2021, I donâ€™t know that that is such a slam dunk, because of the issue of political instability,â€ he said.

&gt; # Why A Year-End Rally Bodes Well For 2021

&gt; Welcome to the last day of 2020! It has been a devastating year in so many ways, yet for investors it has been quite rewarding. Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far, the best end to a year since WWII.

&gt; A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. â€œTurns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&amp;P 500 the following year every single time since World War II,â€ explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. â€œIn fact, January was also higher every single time as well, so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.â€

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile, January was up 5 for 5 as well, rising an impressive 3% on average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Hereâ€™s what the average year looks like after the prior year gains 10% or more the final two months compared to a typical year. Once again, strong returns are the playbook historically.

&gt; # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days

&gt; In a year with some pretty crazy charts, the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year, bot the S&amp;P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right, with just a few hours left in the trading year, the S&amp;P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%, while Long Term US Treasuries, as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd, the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**

&gt; The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time, the S&amp;P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year, but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978, there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.

&gt; # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology

&gt; With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990, the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then, not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years, but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days, they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!

&gt; In terms of cumulative returns, the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018, whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years, while the S&amp;P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore, since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**

&gt; Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years, there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018, AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain, but that's because Apple (AAPL), the sector's largest stock, has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.

&gt; On the downside, just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value, while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly, FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%, so depending on how it acts in the next two days, it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.

&gt; # Growth Dragging on Small Caps

&gt; In the past couple of weeks, we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically, taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps, with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocksâ€”proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)â€”are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th, IWO surpassed the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance, and even after pulling back in the past week, IWO is still in the lead.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**

&gt; As a result of recent moves, there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below, we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**

&gt; As to just how sharp of a reversal this was, in the five days through yesterday's close, the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that, April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months, but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring, the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011, 2008, and a handful of times in the early 2000s.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**

&gt; Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks, small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market. While there was a bit of a turn lower in recent days, it has been nowhere close to as dramatic of a move as growth stocks.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large4.png))**

&gt; In the charts below, we show average performance over the past week of Russell 2000 stocks broken into deciles based on their price to sales and price to book ratios. As shown, the most aggressively valued deciles have averaged the worst performance in the past week. Stocks with low P/S and P/B ratios have not been immune from the weakness, but they have held up significantly better.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading year ahead r/wallstreetbets."
Christmas gift for all my degenerates!,1609605930,ClosetPsychopath,14,"*Long time lurker, first time poster*

This â€œpredictionâ€ is for overstock (OSTK). 
Overstock is currently trading at a strong resistance level as well as itâ€™s 200 day SMA, and well below its 10, 20, 50 and 100 day SMAs.  All these make a bounce likely this week. 

Now if you look at the 2hr chart for OSTK, you will notice that on that chart it is also trading well below its major SMAs. For the past 3 months, the price has been trending down moving sinusoidally, with the high prices bouncing off the 200SMA and low prices bottoming out at roughly 80% 200SMA. 
OSTK is currently trading at ~-2 standard deviations below its 50SMA and when looking at the MACD relative to price between 12/29 and 12/31, there is a divergence. These 3 factors lead me to believe a price reversal is eminent.

Moral of this post, OSTK is trading at $48 right now. The 200SMA (2hr chart) is $61. I predict over the next month (and probably sooner) OSTK will go back up to ~$60. 

Opinions of this analysis is greatly appreciated.

   * COVID proof
   * Solid financials, much more liquid than Amazon
   * China is bound to become the largest economy
   * Political uncertainties are exaggerated
* 70 shares of $CRM at $221 with a price target of $230. Have made this same play quite a few times in the last 2 months.
   * COVID proof
   * A solid company run by a solid CEO with good growth and financials
   * Slack was purchased for $28b but the market has wiped 26% of its market cap off, which is more than $50b so at the very least the overreaction is extended by at least $22b (a 10% increase in market cap from current levels)
   * Short-term PT of $230 but have no doubt this can break above $275 in 2021. A 24% upside.
* 24 shares of $FB at $273 with a price target of $280. Have also done this multiple times during the last few months.
   * COVID proof
   * Earnings coming up near the end of January.
   * Zuck might be a lizard, but those IG ""influencers"" you follow from your fake account so your girlfriend doesn't find out will only keep luring you back in.
   * Political risks surrounding breakup are exaggerated and seem to be an optic play to gain public confidence. Even if this is not the case, the first hearing is years away.
   * Has the potential to breach $325 during 2021. An upside of 20%.
* 4 shares of $AMZN at $3250 with a price target of $3350 at least. Have made a bit over $5k only trading swings between $3000 and $3350.
   * COVID proof
   * Earnings coming up near the end of January.
   * Possible to reach ATH which is around $3500 near earnings.
   * Possible to breach $4000 during the year providing an upside of 23%.
* 275 shares of $PFE at average $38.62 with a price target of $41-42, not sure how this will go. Have made this play once before when I cashed out at $42.75 just a few weeks ago.
   * Only speculative play in my portfolio
   * Not a hold in the long run as this stock is as limp as they come but a reasonable dividend yield. So, not really worried about losing money.

Pretty boring shit, no $GME or $PLTR here but looking forward to seeing what other tickers the community is holding on to."

I've now researched into some great investing opportunities but foolishly, because I invested so highly into Lloyds, I do not have enough collateral to make a substantial profit. Do I pull out of Lloyds, having lost under 3% with the hopes of making this back and more, or do I hold fast and wait for it to enter the green before selling later in the year?"

Disclaimer Iâ€™m in with 600 shares 

- [ ] The most important factors for them going into 2021:
- [ ] Can they pull off their marketing campaign? 
- [ ] Will the plant based movement continue?
IMO yes, its spreading like wildfire in the US, huge demand for it in the UK.
Gen Z and Millenials driving the plant based movement.
Theyâ€™re very connected with social medias can help spread the name in a massive way
- [ ] Trend will continue to grow stronger.
- [ ] $55B market theyâ€™re targeting aggressively to take market share of next year
- [ ] Donâ€™t underestimate the power of brand awareness, this can snowball and be a huge driver for them
- [ ] Can argue brand awareness is what will impact the fundamentals and sp the most
Just scratching the surface of their distribution potential.
Now apparently selling in the UK Costcoâ€™s already, US wide expansion aswell as Mexico

Tons of pictures of empty shelves and their products being sold out on social medias

https://skyhighcapitalinvestments.com/the-most-exciting-food-company-for-the-next-decade-and-beyond/

- [ ] This time of year January people tend to eat healthier, the Q1 report should reflect this boost in sales on top of the benefits of their marketing 

Veganuary 
NitroC advertising company 


- [ ] Vertically integrated: 
- [ ] Meaing they produce everything in their products right from the source
- [ ] They grow their own vegetables and ingredients
- [ ] Manuafacture the final product themselves
- [ ] They innovate rapidly and design their own products aswell
- [ ] This is essential to keep ahead of competitors in the food space.

Catalystâ€™s
Marketing campaign = massive buzz around the brand higher revenue, higher sales.
Biggest catalyst for the history of this company
A lot of positive reviews on social medias like IG and YT
Effect of Marketing campaign really be seen in Q1 earnings 

Undervalued, institutional investors will be loading up on this 

The hype from the SPAC alone has been free advertising 90m in cash from merger 
Cash will be 320m if they call the warrants
(May be exercised next year at some point)companies in their growth stage and attacking a major opportunity. 

Price prediction:

Profitability is not and should not be their main concern which is why I am using Price to sales to compare their valuations:

TTCF have been profitable every quarter also to mention, except Q3 because of one off merger expenses.

Based on P/S ratio:
2021 sp: $45 conservative
          sp: $56 very possible with 3.8B market cap

Q4 potential YOY rev, I have 45
On their analyst day presentation says 39 (conservative)
With them selling out crazy fast in the stores
I canâ€™t see why they wonâ€™t smash their Q4 earnings

Currently SKUâ€™s 21 products
Will have 38 products in 2021
This aggressive expansion = more sales = higher revenue

Addressable market is about 50B growing at at 17% CAGR for that market. Their revenue has been about 40-50m quarterly WITHOUT ANY MARKETING AT ALL.
Should be crazy growth once the marketing campaign starts in Jan.

They should be able to maintain and grow these numbers for years to come, innovation is key here and they have the scope to do it.
And the capacity as theyâ€™ve double their facility size already and plan to scale up again in 2021 doubling facilities again.

RISKS

Risks - Of course marketing is costly and possibility of it not being successful
But TTCF seem to have a very loyal customer base already and their products actually taste good
Other alternative type products donâ€™t taste that great just loaded with salt. 
Overall very excited for their next earnings report.

There are 20M warrants outstanding. 
If they call the warrants that would be an 85M shares outstanding
So TTCF is 85M shares outstanding and $320M in the bank, accounting for the warrant excercise.
What does this mean for the stock price, it can cause dilution if the warrants are exercised, because the underlying company ie TTCF will have to issue new shares, when thereâ€™s more shares the price is diluted by the extra amount of shares created. However in the overall long term picture for TTCF this will be minor.

Conclusion:

In my opinion this a trend that will continue to be strong in 2021, just like what weâ€™ve seen in the EV space. From the start of next year TTCF will be spending aggresively on marketing
Could mean weâ€™ll see some very attractive results in their next Q4, Q1 and onwards earnings reports!!
Solid long term hold, I want to get in early before it takes off."

Alibaba is UNDERVALUED ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€,1609612189,UnpolishedPleb,134,"One after another negative catalysts have been annihilating Alibabaâ€™s share price. First it was the [ANT IPO fiasco](https://imgur.com/kDpBPlg) and then it was CCP regulatory concerns. Do you really think the CCP is on a warpath to meaningfully hinder one of their most profitable companies? If so then stop reading here. This is literally a gift from the CCP and here is why.

First lets start off with some fundamental boomer valuation metrics. According to Nasdaq.com hereâ€™s a comparison of the two largest e-commerce companies.

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” 

ALIBABA Forward P/E: 

2021: 30 

2022: 23 

2023: 17

12 month Forward PEG ratio: 1.46

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” 

AMAZON Forward P/E: 

2021: 73 

2022: 52 

2023:(no estimates)

12 month Forward PEG ratio: 3.22 

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-

As you can see Alibaba is CRITICALLY undervalued compared to Amazon. When PEG is taken into account with P/E it can justify a currently high P/E IF AND ONLY IF said company is expected to grow earnings fast enough YOY. According to Zackâ€™s the E-commerce industry as a whole has a PEG ratio of about 2.56 which would indicate that Alibaba is undervalued in comparison to not only Amazon but most if not all of its peers as well. Lets also not forget that Alibaba recently increased their [share buyback program from 6 billion to 10 bilion](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/alibaba-raises-stock-buyback-plan-to-10-billion-but-stock-continues-to-sink-11609124627). That's an increase of over 66%.... Even Alibaba themselves thinks their shares are undervalued and wants to take advantage of the recent sell off.

Secondly lets check out the technical side of things. Here is a [weekly chart](https://imgur.com/5ffIMmO) that shows a very attractive uptrending pattern for the last few years. It also shows that Alibaba was overextended and needed a healthy pullback. Now it's oversold and in prime territory for a true dip buy opportunity. An opportunity this large has presented itself just 4 times in a little over 2 years. The huge green candle tells me that after the sell off Alibaba bulls were lying in wait for a moment like this to scoop up more shares. 

Lastly  lets break it down in WSB valuation metrics. Daniel Zhang YOLOd his way into an empire and his wifeâ€™s boyfriend(The CCP) has noticed that he is incredibly profitable and doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon. The wife's boyfriend is starting to fear for his top position in the house. This is why the wif'es boyfriend wants to regulate the little autist so that he can maintain power over both his wife and the autist. That said the wife's boyfriend doesn't' want to kick the autist out. He still wants to keep the little autist around because he generates money for him while he hangs out with his wife. 

TLDR; The CCP wants to make sure it stays in position as the wife's boyfriend. Alibaba is undervalued and presents an opportunity if you believe the CCP regulatory concerns are just smoke and mirrors."

But with GME the short interest is at a ludicrous 97.68% according to Yahoo Finance and the free float is 69%. So the VW squeeze was worse in term of the ratio of short interest to float

Palantir [1984] DD,1609622176,TheL0ngGame,3,"Now I had originally left this comment over in r/investing a few days ago but I guess it was too stupid for them to take seriously. Nevertheless, I believe this sub may appreciate it more.

I have a gift for buying the right things for the wrong reasons, despite this, I decided to dive in balls deep when Palantir ipo'd. As my investment grew, I wasn't too phased since picking good investments is normal to me. Curious, I decide to browse the wallstreetbets sub only to be dissappointed to see that you retards had been all over this stock already. Did I think that I was going against the herd by buying this stock? yes. Are you guys the only reason this stock went up?

NO!

yOU autist have just stumbled upon one of the greatest stocks of all time! As said previously in my comment, it is my belief that an artificially intelligent all seeing machine will soon run the world. I have called it the Basilisk, named after Roko's Basilisk. Palantir is essentially the head of the snake. And with the inevitable introduction of AVA, I am laughing to the bank. Metroplolis \[1927\], The Matrix \[1999\], Eagle eye \[2008\], 2001: A space odyssey \[1968\], Idiocracy \[2006\], 1984 \[1984\]- This was all investment grade material that you should have been studying. 

Now i doubt any of you actually have any money left to buy calls or leaps, but understand this.

If Palantir is successful in the future, human freedom won't exist. But you will be rich. The Basilisk will see to it that you are rewarded for assisting in it's creation."

So I am 20 years old and got about a thousand euros that I dont need and want to invest them and eventually in the future  make a living off of investing and trading but I don't know where to start. I need the app or program you guys use to buy and other tips on where I can learn this stuff. I tried googling and read many articles but they honestly just confuse me more and more and I actually dont really know what you guys are doing. Is this day trading, investing in shares or what exactly is it called? For some context when I tried to start learning I went on ""[tradingview.com](https://tradingview.com)"" and looked at many stocks for a few weeks and used the papertrading method so I could learn how it works. I did gain about 100 virtual dollars but I didn't really understand what I was doing. I just bought Tesla shares and Euro/Dollar and then when it went up I closed the positions and boom I got the +100$. 

I really want to educate myself and learn and I think I can be able to do so since I also taught myself how to code and become a software and game developer but I don't know where to look for. 

Can you please provide some sources, courses or something where I can start slowly to get into this stuff and understand and then go one step after another? Articles and blogs I followed where starting somewhere in the middle and needed some basic knowledge but as I have never done anything in this are I am as dumb as someone could be."

""GME GONNA BE BANKRUPT HUUR DURR"" - GME bears

If GME was going bankrupt, it would've done so already during the lockdown, not in the beginning of a console cycle. Here's a brief look at the credit markets backdrop and I'll explain why GME won't go bankrupt anytime soon and is in fact very bullish for GME.

I'm not gonna go into how GME improved their balance sheets and got FCF, lots of people did that already, but I'll say something in WSB terms. Printers go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR yo. When the IG and HYG credit market went to shit back in March and April, JPOW pulled out his magnificent printers and set it to BRR mode, the end result is well functioning credit markets with spreads that are tight af. With yields in treasuries and IG being low, people are forced to look for yield in junk bonds. This is why you hear about how CCL was able to raise debt without using ships as collateral and airlines using their flyer points as collateral to raise debt. Creditors are willing to lend at laughable rates  just to get yield. Now GME doesn't need to raise more debt, it is meeting it obligations early but if it ever needs to raise capital for future growth operations, they can easily raise capital in the credit market for as long as JPOW sets the printer in BRR mode. Which we know won't change until at least 2023, I honestly think it'll be longer than that  but it doesn't matter anyways since wsb doesn't even look 6 months out ahead. Notice how we haven't had as much bankruptcies as people thought we would ?(small businesses don't count) Well that's because of our great lord and savior, JPOW

So there you have it, betting on GME bankruptcy is essentially betting against JPOW losing control of the credit market. **JPOW is in effect GME gang's daddy #1**. (iloveyoujpow) 

""BUT GME HAD NEGATIVE EPS FOR SO MANY YEARS!"" - more gay GME bears

You see the problem with bears is that they are always backwards looking, no vision for the future, no hopes for anything, always depressing. For some reason they can't understand that a lot of the market participants are writing off 2020 because of the pandemic, they also can't understand GME is cyclical and moves along with the console cycle, meaning we are now in the early days of a gme pump. Their inability to look forward is in fact the number 1 reason why their wives have chad forward looking boyfriends. **Our forward looking chad is of course Ryan Cohen (Daddy #2)**, I don't even need to explain more, but GME GANG daddy #2 obviously has a vision and he is more than ready to double down on his bet, buying GME at $16 just two weeks ago. He had a few mysterious tweets recently and people are speculating that he is ready to make another move. I'm not going to join the speculation  but the fact that he bought at $16 means that is probably the floor price and I would go all in with calls if it ever dips below that.  

""THEY HAVE NO VIABLE BUSINESS MODEL IN THE AGE OF ECOMMERCE"" - Gay bear and Melvin capital

We have to give credit where it's due, Melvin capital likely had significant alpha with their investment thesis. If you look at their holdings, you'll see that they are long ecommerce and short specialty retail. They saw the demise of various brick and mortar stores back around 2015 and executed on that thesis. I'd argue that the covid pandemic essentially pulled forward all the earnings growth and priced in a lot of that growth with high PE multiples. The problem with that thesis is that it is now old, ecommerce is a crowded trade and this will not be an alpha generating thesis.  The best way to generate alpha is now to invest in a new counter thesis that can outperform the crowded ecommerce thesis. 

Omnichannel is one of such counter thesis, it's starting to get hyped everywhere. This is why Sherman repeats that word like he's autistic, this guy probably mutters it while banging his wife but judging by his conference call, she's probably never been excited by him. Likely he doesn't know how to execute on that thesis, thank god for GME GANG DADDY RC. 

That's not to say he is useless, despite all the shit we gave him. Sherman managed to close down unprofitable stores, reduced inventory and got cashflow positive during a pandemic. This is textbook shit but still very important. and despite the letters RC put out, he could be very receptive of his ideas for all we know. He has shown to be somewhat shareholder friendly through previous buybacks and he did not rule out further share buybacks. Sherman himself holds over 1million shares and has not yet sold them as far as I know. The shelf offering concerns seems to have faded for now, and it will become smaller as the stock price increases. I really just think GME management wants to use that to capitalize on any potential pumps in the stock. This will probably be re-invested anyways.

So what did GME do so far to improve its business model? So far I've seen the following

1. Pivot to ecommerce and improving ecommerce sales - which has seen decent growth
2. Diversifying sales to include more high margin items like PC accessories, PC monitors, etc ( If I speculate, there may be partnerships with certain brands
3. Focusing on loyalty programs like power ups - I'll never understand loyalty programs but some people are retardedly loyal to stores that offer rewards. If they can offer good incentives they can achieve high conversion rates , as far as I know, GameStop is the only specialty video game retailer in north America that offers such reward programs.
4. Store rebranding - this might be good for their goodwill, which got hammered over the years

Daddy RC has more plans for GME and we can only speculate what they might be right now, but with 12% stake, he has what he needs to go full on activist on the BoD. I expect to see some departures and replacements in the reasonably near future. 

If that's not enough for you, here's a few more possible catalysts for the stock that I don't see a lot of people mentioning 

1. A possible new Nintendo console release in \~1-2 years 
2. Currently distressed commercial REITs = ability to negotiate lower rent = more $$$
3. Likely return of inflation (debatable but money supply ballooned and we are seeing velocity pick up a bit) with JPOW promising to keep rates at 0% even when inflation comes back = bullish for all stocks, bears will get slaughtered
4. OG printer Yellen manning the treasury in a month + possible dem senate = more stimmy checks = more money going into GME
5. If sales improve and balance sheets continue improve, we might see more credit upgrades 
6. Better sales = possible dividend re-instatement , I couldn't care less about dividends but guess who's going to be paying? The shorts lol.  If Sherman had balls, he would pull an OSTK and announce a special dividend , which will actually lead to a short squeeze while wsb laughs collectively as  we get meme returns from this boomer move. 

I'm sure the OG GME bulls can think of more reasons, I've been in and out of GME since it was at $9 (my CC's kept on getting assigned).

Current positions

500x GME shares - ready to buy more at the dip Monday and Tuesday, going to sell a few puts

15x Apr $20c Leaps

10x  Jan 15 $20c YOLOs

So does this mean I think GME will squeeze to $69 by next friday? No. GME short interest has been high for years, Melvin capital isn't going to be that worried since their GME position is likely hedged and not a big part of their holdings (they're probably laughing at wsb for all the memes we put out). We will likely have a few more dips next week which I will buy. Depending on how much WSB pumps GME before ICR or console sale release (which I expect to be lackluster due to shortages), I'll either take profit or sell some ITM calls if IV's are high. Then buy the dip.

TLDR:   
GME bankruptcy is out of the question for the next 3-5 years because of the macro and credit market, RC is putting a floor of $16 on the price (debatable but you're welcome to buy puts or short below $16). bears need to stop looking backwards and be anticipatory. GME short squeeze likely not going to happen overnight but a bit slowly as more people realize GME isn't going bankrupt and either buy in or cover their short positions."

What to do when your stocks go up suddenly,1609634208,gogoisik,23,"Hello everyone, i have been investing for a while but im quite a beginner. I have some stocks in my portfolio that i strongly believe that they will go up with a big ratios in future. Yet im still making not too much money so i buy that stocks very poorly with so small amounts every month. Now one of them increased %70 in a day and because my money on that stock is so low i didnt wanna sell, because in long term i believe it will contiune to grow. Yet now the stock came back to its normal value and i got nothing from that huge jump. Should i sell the little percentage or sell the whole stock in that time? I always hear its nice to buy more when the stocks that you trust go down, but what to do when its up?"

Palantir (PLTR) is heavily exposed to oil and gas prices... what?,1609636118,ArcheronX,56,"Just watched a short clip on CNBC which was explaining why a bunch of IPO stocks were down in the final week of trading for 2020. Gina Sanchez stated Palantir was down due to heavy exposure to the oil and gas industry but that makes zero sense to me as I don't see how oil prices are even related to a big data company like Palantir.

Can someone explain to me how lying on national T.V is allowed? 

Quote - ""Palantirâ€™s stock could also get hit for a while, after debuting at a lofty valuation, she said, raising concerns about the companyâ€™s exposure to the struggling oil and gas industry.""

PLTR most important software company in the world,1609636757,AffectionateHawk4422,309,"This is easy fucktards, so listen up. PLTR is a bull stock and is going to the moon. So if you are not a bull and you are one of the following:

&amp;#x200B;

1. A punk ass b%$#ch
2. Crybaby
3. Paperhand motherfucker
4. Part of shitron
5. Suffer extreme anxiety seeing a stock unable to go up, EVERY single day. Even after is up 137% since the DPO... Remember the stock has less than a year!

Then DON'T buy it. This isn't BAC or C, GE, AAPL, or any other stock that is more stable. This is a big swinging dick motherfucker that can go up, down, sideways, or where ever it pleases. If you can't handle that, then GTFO and back to paper trading. 

Now if you are a pro, a true retard, an autist savant a badass motherfucker that has balls of steel and can stand pressure like none other, then this DD is for you. You are buying what papa Karp said will be the next MOST important software company in the world (""**We are going to be the most important software company in the world**""). And the guy couldn't care less about the current stock price because the stock will be mooning, volatility is obviously expected when pricing a stock:

""we are very comfortable with investors toying around that it could be like this it could be like that, we are gonna the world best software"" Alex Karp. CNBC interview. 

Some of you might be afraid because the stock is overvalued and the lockup period and this and that. **I'm just going to point out something ABSOLUTELY critical:**

&amp;#x200B;

**Snowflake** (NYSE:SNOW)

PS Ratio: 162

**IPO**

**C3.AI** (NYSE:AI)

PS Ratio: 81.96

**IPO**

**U** (NYSE:U)

PS Ratio: 81.96

**IPO**

&amp;#x200B;

And our dear Palantir has: 

PS ratio: 44.23

Launched into the market as a: **DPO**

And what is everybody saying about PLTR? No, the stock is extremely overvalued, shorted by citron and bla bla bla. You wanna know why the first two are not being shorted? Their price targets not lowered? Yeah, because they were launched as IPO by the big banks. Almost nobody is saying shit about SNOW, even though the company is astronomically overvalued. That stock is covered in ointment made from JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and every other major bank. Because well, they don't like getting a cold shoulder and have it IN for PLTR.  

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**: You are betting on a company that will be worth at least X30 times what is worth now.  Give it time, stop being a crybaby or a paper hand MF.

DIS: Moon Mission 2021,1609637612,baggholder420,41,"**Prediction: DIS may soon surpass 200 at early 2021, and potentially to trade between 250--300 this year. How fast it rises will depend on streaming growth. If the subscription continues to add 20M per Q, it will be the next $420 / 1T company within 1-2 years.**

&amp;#x200B;

As a long-time bagholder of TSLA (disclaimer: not any more), DIS in 2020 reminds me a lot of TSLA in 2019: Stock went down big-time during Q1 due to impacted business; slowly recovered throughout the year, then quickly ATH at year-end due to future growth (TSLA last Q4 for improved delivery and cybertruck event; DIS this Q4 bc streaming growth and investor day).

Bears argue the park business is down, a lack of new contents on Disney +, and stock overvalued on current revenue. Bulls believe the pent-up demand of park after covid, a sea of new contents coming to Disney +, and potentialy hyper growth in streaming revenueu. It is strikingly similar to the debates around TSLA for years (and in fact many growth stocks). And bears always lose because investors love growth at end of the day.

This year there will be &gt;10 Disney movies on Disney + premiere access in 2021, vs just Mulan in 2020, plus many other TV series and movies only on Disney +. Given DIS's superior brands, top cultural influence, and unrivalled quality, if streaming growth is able to break into 200M-300M subscribers in 1-2 years, there will be huge profit and cash &amp; DIS will break 1T at that point.

&amp;#x200B;

Going forward, every ER they update the subscription number, it may boost the stock price. **The stock currently has many short-term catalysts for the next ER:**

1. At 35% capacity, Disney FL Parks are extremely full. It regularly hits capacity since November, is all sold out for New Year Eve. And China Park has been open and on fire for the whole quarter. This is a strong signal for park's pent up demand, and bolds well for DIS revenue in Q4.
2. Soul turns out to be an unexpected success, and is globally acclaimed. Not really a kids movie, but widely praised and may become an Oscar winner. Box-office wise, it has grossed over USD 20M in China in a week, gaining more and more popularity despite zero ads in China  (10M in past two days alone), and is expected to gross 60M-100M in China at least.
3. With Mando last two episodes, Soul, and Mulan all appearing on Disney + for free during December (especially they are on Disney + after 12.2, the cut-off date for the 86.8M subscriber disclosed on DIS investor day), Disney + shall have a subscriber count of 90--100M as of end of 2020. Any number within the range is bullish --- if they can hit close to 100M, it will be perceived as a monumental success (imagine &gt;10M subscriber for one month only!), showing investors the big power of Disney brand, and may immediately rocket the stock to 250.
4. With increased park revenue and DIS + growth in this Q, DIS has a good chance to beat Q4 estimates for revenue and profit (based on Yahoo finance). And they have beat twice in past two Q.

It does not mean the stock has no risk, if the streaming growth slows down in a material way, or Macro uncertainty rises again, then stock will certainty react negatively.

Strategy-wise, do stocks or leaps --- stocks will double or triple, and leaps have a chance to five-fold or more at current streaming growth. I personally hold 2022 and 2023 leaps. No weeklies --- if the stock is no higher than 200 at early Feb, and no change in company prospect then, it may worth a small try on ER calls then.

Feel free to short the stock --- imagine betting against a strong growth story, the most iconic company, a kids-favorite brand, the best animation studio, the legend of galaxy, and all the superheroes --- it is as bad as betting against Elon, if not more so (and throughout 2019, many bet against Elon)."

$TPII will explode in 2021,1609639517,SpittinOpinions,2,"Triad Pro Innovators ($TPII) has developed proprietary battery technology for use in multiple industries. Their battery is green, eco, and can pair with solar and never need to be plugged in. It has the potential to replace lithium batteries. They have proved their concept within the EV industry with golf carts and are set to announce further applications within the EV market, next with light trucks. Their potential with off-grid batteries and other energy storage is huge!

$TPII has a ridiculously small $7 million market cap and is currently at $0.11 per share. I absolutely expect them to run to $1.00+ in January and $5.00+ easily in 2021. Other similar companies with lesser technologies and companies that own no patents have blown up in price recently. $TPII owns patents and has full control of their tech. They are barely known and once word fully gets out and people see the potential, their price will explode.

I have spoken with Murray Goldenberg, President of Triad Pro Innovators. His number is available if you look for it but I can't post it here. He is aware of the recent uptick in investor interest in his company. Here is his update:

 â€¢ They currently have three EV products developed that use their prorpietary e-cell technology. The SPREE golf cart is just one of them and he wouldn't share what the other two are because it hasn't been made public. It is safe to assume one of them is small trucks. They have other applications for their technology developed and in development also. Updates are pending.

 â€¢ They are currently selling the golf cart and sales have increased recently. However they have their sights on bigger markets. The golf cart proved their concept and validated their technology. 

 â€¢ They are in contact with several different firms to help with the funding. COVID has caused some delays but something should be sorted out very soon. They have no toxic funding currently and will not take any on.

 â€¢ They do plan on addressing the public soon, likely early in 2021. They started their Twitter account in December and have hinted a bit at things to come. Expect press releases in January.

 â€¢ He believes the technology they have created is so great that they intend to take their time and do everything correctly.

 â€¢ He invited me to their Arizona facility for a tour and demonstration of their technology, but I declined as that is nowhere near where I live

In short, $TPII absolutely has something. They need to finish the coordination of funding and develop a sound go-to-market strategy. This will happen and is already in the works.Â $TPIIÂ will soar when they make an announcement. He has spoken with counsel about doing that right. Murray came off as a genuine guy who knows they have something special. This is a real company with real, revolutionary technology. Their $7 million market cap is a function of them keeping silent while they perfect their tech. They're ready to start moving now."

***A single prediction for the New Year.***

*Those unfamiliar with the Federal Reserve Boardâ€™s Regulation T will hear lots about it during 2021. The rule limits the percentage of an investment in equity securities that can be borrowed with a margin loan. A wake-up call is scheduled...*

*It was widely reported this week that total margin debt reached a new high of $722B. The WSJâ€™s 12/28 lead Business and Finance story profiled a $TSLA retail investor, a civil engineer, who had parlayed a $23k option investment in $TSLA into a $2m position. Oh boy. The gentleman is to surely and genuinely be commended for the investment. An 87x gain in a short period is extraordinary (I've never done that, nor will I). That said, a quick perusal of $TSLA twitter commentary and recommendations is terrifying.*

*One can read the Journal article,* [*Investors Double Down on Stocks, Pushing Margin Debt to Record TSLA*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-double-down-on-stocks-pushing-margin-debt-to-record-11609077600)*, and draw two conclusions. One, â€œThis must be extremely dangerous,â€ or two, â€œSurely I can get rich quick too.â€ Human nature being what it isâ€¦ For the latter, the civil engineer offers this advice on his Twitter page, â€œIf you have no Tesla call options, you may want to do the math and consider using LEAPS as a way to accelerate your accumulation of Tesla stock. 40X in 2020. Another 50X by 2025.â€ Whoa.*

*A series of Q&amp;A tweets ensues (thanks for the heads up* [*@RomanRubinstein*](https://twitter.com/romanrubinstein?lang=en)*) on which broker/dealers offer the most margin, the lowest interest rate on margin debt, and how to borrow the most money and obtain the maximum leverage by purchasing call options. â€œMaintain margin value of 50% in my portfolio and the margin borrowing rides forever,â€ goes the advice. Please consider the danger of heeding this advice. The engineer should risk-off and live a happy life.*

*A whole bunch of people are going to lose a whole bunch of money.*

*Reading through a series of tweets among the Tesla (and others) option crowd, you see little, if any, mention of maintenance margin requirements. FINRA requires investors, strike that, speculators, to maintain equity of at least 25% of the value of an account. Leverage kills. Maintenance rates can be set above the minimum threshold. The concept of posting shares in stocks like $TSLA, $TWTR, or any established company trading for 20x or 30x sales &amp; borrowing half of the value and then buying calls on the same shares posted as collateral is insanity. The only â€œmathâ€ a speculator should be doing is knowing at what price against the shares in the account will new equity be required. Most brokers donâ€™t wait around for a customer to come up with new cash or securities to deposit. What do they do?*

*They sell down your shares to get to equity compliance. More decline? More forced selling. Depending on maintenance margin thresholds, you can lose it all in a hurry. Red flags are abundant, beyond simply the new record high in total margin and credit market debt outstanding. You can see the bubble in the number of single-contract call options outstanding, in the number of new retail accounts being opened with margin and allowed option trading, and even in the tone of surety by speculators regarding prospects for wildly expensive shares like Tesla.*

*I never thought Iâ€™d again see the kind of mania like we saw in the late 1990â€™s, but here we are. Memories of what can and is likely to happen are long gone. Even a number of professional investors have suspended price as a key determinant of value.  A respected and well-known retired professional investor suggested on Twitter recently that I donâ€™t understand â€œ$TSLA growth math or basic investment theory,â€ that â€œstocks look forward, not backwardâ€ and that â€œP/Eâ€™s are a function of exponential growth rates, not industry.â€*

*The last time an investment pro came unglued was January 2000 at a newspaper roundtable. The C.I.O/PM for one of the largest &amp; oldest growth &amp; income funds at the time took exception to the notion that $MSFT shareholders would lose money for the next 15 years, which they did. Iâ€™d written 6 pages on the prediction in my 1/1/2000 letter (on the website) and discussed it at the roundtable. My co-panelist became unhinged because he and his firm had 5% of capital in $MSFT, which was then a $620B market cap on $20B in sales, 31x sales &amp; 80x earnings.*

*You can apply the same logic to $TSLA or to any number of dangerously overvalued fashionable disruptive growers today. The Tesla bull proffering margined purchase of $TSLA LEAPS expects a $1,000 share price this year, $5,000 the next and $22,000 by 2025.*

*Now, a $22,000 stock price, assuming no further dilution above todayâ€™s 1.1B fully diluted shares outstanding, gets you to a $24 trillion market value, which must be reasonable given that the entire market value of the S&amp;P 500 today is only \~$31 trillion &amp; global GDP is $88T. When your TAM (the new eyeballs) is 100% global auto market share, robotaxi, energy grid, insurance and economic population of Mars, no price is too high. No argument that Tesla has made great strides in manufacturing efficiency and are now producing a more reliable product.*

*I also believe disruption of the auto industry will require an enormous amount of capital to grow and the established OEMâ€™s wonâ€™t play dead. You can't simply separate auto margins and capital requirements from nearly infinite profitability earned by selling software upgrades. Shouldnâ€™t the upgrades be considered part of total vehicle cost? To what extent did the Apples and Microsofts of the world thrive on a regular upgrade cycle, much of which was and is planned. How often are you compelled into a new iPhone or iPad? Prior to the subscription model, at what point did Microsoft not support an older operating system or Office suite? Will EV buyers purchase a new car every 2-3 years? How much of the world can afford a more expensive vehicle than the current global average car price?*

*Regardless of one's beliefs on business quality &amp; growth prospects, paying a too-high price can destroy future investment return. #neversell? When price becomes ridiculous to the most optimistic business case you #bettersell. Price matters and the current environment is nuts. The current folly for price not mattering, or being justifiably high, reminds me of a well known sell-side report on Berkshire Hathaway in 1998 which assumed as undervalued both $BRKâ€™s shares and its stock portfolio against an assumed â€œreasonableâ€ 40x market multiple.*

*Berkshireâ€™s shares, expensive, would fall by half over the next 18 months to a February 2000 low. Itâ€™s become fashionable to explain investment process by saying price is the last consideration. Too often lately, price isnâ€™t even a consideration, especially for holy growers. While I did not have a short position on $MSFT in 2000, I do have a very small recent short on Tesla today so take my comments w/ a grain of salt. I did buy $MSFT in '06 after it fell by \~75% and owned it for a decade, trimming when dear and adding to the position when cheap.*

*Short selling is very risky and those w/ sizable short positions on Tesla at the outset of 2020 would have suffered real damage given the 720% advance during the year. I've read that shorts lost $38B during '20 alone on their collective positions &amp; short interest is way down. I happen to think the valuation is now so large to protect against a continued runaway price, particularly now that* u/elonmusk *secured its entry in the S&amp;P 500 by engineering 4 quarters of profits by cutting R&amp;D, SG&amp;A and thanks to environmental credits courtesy $GM &amp; $FCA.*

*Still, Iâ€™d never employ a large short position given unlimited downside and a max return of 100%. Margin is required against short positions. What appears to be a growing army of retail option traders, many employing sizable margin debt, is a recipe for disaster. Price and quality conscious investors get uncomfortable at times like these. I am extremely uncomfortable. I hope those that have no idea what they are doing heed growing and now very high risk and fully understand downside and what margin calls and maintenance margin mean.*

*Many, many speculators will lose much and even all of their money at some point as this bubble breaks. Now is the time to reduce risk. You could feel badly for employees that were paid in non-qualified stock options and kept their shares upon exercise in the late 1990â€™s. When shares plummeted in the wake of the tech bubble the tax liability due on gain realized as income upon exercise was still due and payable, despite shares that were way below the exercise price. It was bad. Many lost everything but werenâ€™t in a position to understand risk.*

*Borrowing against Tesla (or any) shares and buying call options presents serious deliberately assumed risk. For perspective, a 92% decline takes the shares back to where they started 2020! With margin, it will take way less than a 92% decline to introduce wipeout.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Responding to a PM who claims that the $TSLA price target of $1,200, total EV adoption of 20%, and 5% market share in global auto-manufacturing is reasonable, Bloomstran had this to say:**

*You have EV adoption rising from 3% to 20% in five years, a 6x increase (46% CAGR) and Tesla market share at 25%. 2019 global new vehicle sales totaled \~95m units and will be way lower this year. Let's call 2020 a throwaway for the industry, and hats off to* [*$TSLA*](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click) *for growing. From the 2019 base, if we assume 4% market growth then new global units in 2025 would be 115m and at your expected 20% share Tesla would sell 29 million vehicles. Is this your assumption? Sounds aggressive given Teslaâ€™s 500k unit run rate for 2020 and 1/2% market share.*

*Now, US new vehicle prices are $38k but significantly lower worldwide, letâ€™s say $30k per vehicle sold globally. The average Tesla looks to range from high $30kâ€™s for the Model 3 to $55k for the Model 3 Performance to $125k for the Model X Performance fully loaded.  What do you expect for an average selling price for Tesla in 2025? Iâ€™d presume that as market share expands ASPâ€™s will have to fall to affordable. Iâ€™m trying to get to a revenue number.*

*Perhaps the governments of the world will be giving $2k per person, $8k per family of 4 in annual perpetuity, surely making new cars more affordable! If Tesla sells 29m units in 2025 @ $34.5k per unit, that gets sales to $1 trillion, a CAGR of \~102% for five years. Reasonable?*

*Moving on, you have a 2025 EPS target of $24/share. On how many shares shall we apply your expected per-share figure? Shares outstanding at 9/30 totaled 948m, up from 905m at yearend 2019. An additional $5B in shares were sold recently to the public in â€œat-the-marketâ€ sales.  The sales were done with no roadshow, risk disclosure or prospectus, unless Goldmanâ€™s report upgrading the shares from neutral to buy &amp; a new price target of $780, up from $455, issued days before the announced sale and Goldmanâ€™s retention as selling agent, as a â€œprospectus.""*

*If the shares were sold at an average of \~$600/share, the share count would now be 8.3m shares higher, so call the total 956m. You have a price target of $1,200 for the shares, so letâ€™s not forget to include in the count any option and RSU shares issued but not yet exercised.  Recall,* [*@elonmusk*](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) *was granted 20m option shares (now 100m thanks to the split) in 2018 by* [*@larryellison*](https://twitter.com/larryellison) *and Elonâ€™s associates on the board. Fully diluted shares total 1.113B right now, and if the stock keeps rising we can assume all options will be exercised and outstanding.*

*So, how many shares should we apply to your $24 EPS target? If we assume zero further dilution (realistic?), then using the 1.113B fully diluted shares including the recent $5b sale, we get to $26.7B in net income. On an even $1 trillion in revenues, thatâ€™s a 2.67% profit margin, just a bit higher than the auto industry average of 3% and approaching $MSFTâ€™s 30%.*

*One last missing piece of information, which I havenâ€™t seen mentioned by the Tesla bulls or in your message to me is how much capital will be required to grow sales from 500k units to 29m over the next 5 years?  It looks like over the history of* [*$TSLA*](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click) *the company has raised $26.5B in equity capital (including the recent $5B) and $16.5B in debt and preferred equity, so a total of $43B. Tesla has a cumulative loss of $5.7B, so it hasnâ€™t produced a positive return on capital.*

*For its last 4 quarters GAAP profits totaled $5.56B, which yields a 2.5% return on capital (equity net of retained losses plus debt minus cash, all adjusted for the recent $5B sale). I fully understand companies can surely lose money or earn little profit as they scale.  With the recent sale of $5B Tesla now has \~$20B in cash. Is this sufficient to finance its growth over the next 5 years as the company grows units by 102% per year?*

*Since I donâ€™t lean on brevity and given my lack of understanding of basic investment theory, letâ€™s summarize the missing data points necessary to get the stock to your target of $1,200 per share, 50 times your 2025 EPS target of $24 per share. Needed: 1) Tesla unit sales in 2025? 2) Average selling price per unit? 3) Any non-auto related sales â€“ insurance, robotaxi, insurance, energy sales? 4) Shares outstanding? 5) Total capital: Additional paid in capital, debt, preferred equity, cash?*

*At your 50x $24 EPS $1,200  price target,* [*$TSLA*](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click) *returns 11.2% pa from Thursdayâ€™s $705.67 close. I happen to think shares in* [*$BRK*](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BRK&amp;src=cashtag_click)*, my largest holding, are likely to compound at roughly that rate, assuming a 10% ROE and a terminal price at 1.3x book value, up from \~1.2x today.*"

TLRY Tendy Update,1609641614,mjfarraher88,44,"Hey everyone,

Back at it with an update from my post a few weeks ago. Been following the GA Runoff day in and day out. Been backing up the truck with 126 TLRY Calls to $15 expiring in March, and still adding.

Hereâ€™s what I got:

-Voter turnout has been great and demographics strongly favor a democratic win, for now. Early/absentee votes shattered the old runoff record in GA; so far over 3m votes have been cast (record is 2.1m votes TOTAL.)

-Over 100k new votes have been cast, thereâ€™s a huge young registrant vote, and 38% of all registered voters in GA have voted.

-Dems have out-raised Republicans about 2:1.

-Polls favor a Democratic victory, but polls usually lean left. Whatâ€™s interest is that the betting odds have shifted more in favor of Democrats, yet Republicans are still the favorite as the probability of Democrats taking both seats is a harder feat by the numbers.

-Lastly, Trumps rhetoric about voter fraud and rigged elections, etc. is damaging for Republican turnout, most notably his supporters which Loeffler and Perdue need to secure the Senate. Mondayâ€™s rally will either uplift Republican voters to get out and vote or deal the final blow to the party. Trump has even attacked both Republican candidates as well as other GA Republican State officials repeatedly for several issues from the stimulus checks to competence in handling the vote count amongst other things. Thereâ€™s speculation by a faction of Republicans that Trump is purposefully sabotaging the race, to send a message to Republicans that without him they are nothing.

Anyways keep an eye out. I think that if voter turnout can stay around 4m then Dems have a really good chance to pull this off. The more votes that come through on Election Day, the higher the chance for Republican control of the Senate.

Iâ€™m willing to take my chances here.

"E2open: Hugely undervalued AI/Cloud SaaS used by Microsoft, Google, AMD, Boeing, etc. Merging in early Q1",1609643326,mango1144,52,"In early Q1 P-C-P-L is merging with E2open. E2open has disruptive AI / Cloud technology for the supply-chain industry. They are widely used by big name customers including Google, Microsoft, Boeing, Walmart, Coca Cola, UPS, AMD, NVIDIA, Abbott, and dozens of others.

What differentiates them from other (more boring) supply chain management companies is the way they use AI to predict changes in supply and demand. Basically, E2open allows companies to see 10 steps ahead into the future to forecast how much inventory they will need based on hundreds of variables (geopolitics, resource availability, etc). This saves companies hundreds of millions in waste. CEO Michael Farlekas  compares it to working at a lemonade stand and being able to know ahead of time exactly how many lemons you will need. Obviously this will save you from wasting money on lemons that would spoil. E2open is the only company that integrates this type of AI technology with a vast data Cloud network.

E2open uses a subscription model to make consistent sustainable revenue from their 1000+ customers. There are multiple services they offfer, but over 50% of their customers only use 1 service. What's nice is that existing customers go on to utilize more and more of their services as they realize the value it adds to their companies. Google for example paid E2open twice as much over the course of 2 years. E2open makes additional revenue from new customers, and also by strategic value-adding acquisitions. The SPAC deal is allowing E2open to clean up their balance sheet so they can add value to their software portfolio (and charge higher premiums to existing customers) and continue making acquisitions.

E2open has been growing at a rapid clip since they were taken private in 2015. In 2015 they made $80M in revenue and in 2020 they made $335M. That's 420% growth in 5 years, or roughly +84% growth per year.

In the last 5 years they increased their revenue +420% by value-adding acquisitions they've made over the last decade --- Icon (2013), Serus Corp (2014), Terra Technology (2016), Orchestro (2016), Steelwedge (2017), Zyme (2017), Entomo and Birch Worldwide (2018), Inttra (2018), and Amber Road (2018) --- and integrating these different services to create a beautiful comprehensive end-to-end platform.

Somewhat surprisingly, their projections for 2021 are much lower at only +10% estimated revenue growth, which is the main reason most would argue P-C-P-L is trading so close to the NAV. However, 10% growth is actually really solid when you look at their margins and consider that 80% of their revenue is recurring with excellent customer retention. Institutional investors especially will appreciate E2open as the reliable revenue generating machine that it has  become. 

I'm also still optimistic about valuing E2open as a growth stock and feel the 10% is a low-ball estimate based on comparisons to the median growth of other supply chain management companies. I'm suspecting E2open will consistently  outperform expectations on a quarterly as the SPAC capital equips them to capitalize on their services, continue making acquisitions, and ultimately tap into millions in white space opportunity.

Even if E2open maintained a 10% growth rate  and if this were factored into its valuation, $11/share is still too damn low. E2open compares itself to Descartes, Kinaxis, Manhattan, and Spscommerce. With a median of 10.7x revenue, E2 was only at 7x, and with a median of 34.7x, E2 was only at 21.3x, meaning E2open has a much higher upside than its peers.

Institutions will bring the stock price up to par with it's peers and I believe the low ball projected growth is a conservative number that they will completely destroy when you consider their growth of +400% over the last 5 years. While 10% is perfectly fine for a company like E2open, I'm expecting the trend of the last 5 years to continue in 2021 and we'll be seeing some exciting numbers. 

My PT pre-merge is 15 and 25 EOY assuming their projected 10% revenue growth. If E2open surpasses 2021 expected revenue as I'm suspecting and they have major quarterly beats, I'm holding until 50.

Disclaimer: This is my largest position. I'm in 2500 shares at 10.87."

**A Value-Based A.I. Investment**  

&amp;#x200B;

In the era of growing small businesses and increasing brand presence, the internet appears to be a vast and difficult space to make a lasting impression on from a small business perspective. Small businesses may have insufficient entries in Google, Yahoo, and other search engines, where clients are likely to discover them. This is significant for these businesses, because if their information is inaccurate or missing, it will turn away potential customers. Yext, a growing New York based company under the ticker YEXT, provides a solution for modifying these entries and increasing the internet presence of small businesses.  YEXT shows promise as a growing long term stock due to its unique product line and hopeful financials.

In a sense, Yext is like Google but for enterprises that require more depth than Google can provide for them, and they actually use Google to help companies advertise and gain traction with consumer base using their APIs that are integrated with consumer platforms. The advertising industry is huge, as weâ€™ve seen Google, Facebook, and Snapchat dominate simply off reaching consumers, and collecting their data. Yext bridges the gap between businesses and unstructured data of potential consumers and existing consumers, setting them up in a multi-billion dollar industry expected to continually increase for the future. 

Their main product line includes Answers: a search engine, Listings: an advertising tool to get your companyâ€™s products onto multiple platforms, Pages: a tool that helps get your business at the top of every location search, Reviews: which helps you engage with customer feedback, and Knowledge Graph/Analytics which helps business owners see their customer interactions with their webpages and other online presence. Websites used to be everything for a business but now a business requires presence across multiple platforms and integration with every search engine, map, or social media. The more a businessâ€™ online presence is spread the more analytics you need too, and Yext is the amalgamation of the entire businessâ€™ internet presence. This cloud-based software is easy to use, and itâ€™s used by several reputable companies; including huge fast food chains, travel companies, car manufacturers and even banks. 

Yext solves the problem of particular consumer questions and connects the respective business with precisely what the consumer was looking for. Specific questions such as â€œwealth advisor near me who specializes in healthcareâ€ (an example they used in their past annual report) will become increasingly easier to answer with the newest developments in Artificial Intelligence. The control of the ever-changing facts of a business are what enable it to spread its sales. Up-to-date and relevant information on every nook and cranny of the web has become a necessity, as convenience has become the most necessary commodity. Poor site experience is a huge detractor for the large majority of shoppers, and if businesses are able to retain this potential loss in customers theyâ€™d be willing to pay anything. Managing an online presence using one dashboard is going to be a very desirable service for all businesses, regardless of size. Yext links all the chains together in the cloud, for Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri, and even the Chinese WeChat, all services which are improving more and more in terms of their search capabilities and theyâ€™re growing in popularity.

&amp;#x200B;

The product or service a company provides is the most crucial aspect of a companyâ€™s success, and YEXT seems to deliver on its product. The solution requires a subscription that can be priced according to a businessâ€™ specific needs. YEXT does not seem to have as many recognizable competitors. Its main competitors, Birdeye and Chatmeter, are both private companies with no real news about an IPO anytime soon, while YEXT has been public on the NYSE for three years. From this perspective, YEXT maintains an advantage over its competitors due to it being more recognizable and financially stronger due to its valuation reaching over a billion after going public. However, a reported issue with the product is that listings may go back to normal after a contract with a small business terminates. This is justifiable, because a small business could use the service for a month and reap all benefits. To improve this aspect of the solution that is controversial, maybe a potential solution could be negotiating a minimum period the contract has to be active in order for listings not to revert when it is terminated. Despite this drawback, Yext Inc. has innovated in this niche field and is emerging as a frontrunner in back-end listing modification.

Now that we have established that YEXT will likely be a frontrunner in structuring advertising data, we need to establish WHY this is a growing industry, as YEXT is heavily dependent on the growth of eCommerce and other forms of online and in person business. Without businesses, Yext will have no source of revenue so the expansion of commerce is critical to Yextâ€™s revenue. Fortunately, eCommerce and small businesses are trending upwards, indicating a healthy future for YEXT. One way to examine if this industry is growing is to analyze advertisement spending, as more online businesses directly correlates to more money spent on advertising. The graph below regarding digital advertising spending clearly illustrates that online business is growing, with advertisement spending nearly doubling over the six years.

Another way to gauge the health of the industry YEXT is heavily dependent on is to take a look at the growing amount of transactions online. Transactions correlate to greater revenue generated via the internet and thus a greater need for YEXT to introduce smaller businesses to this growing market. The chart below from Statista portrays the growth of Mobile POS payments and Digital commerce over seven years, almost tripling in total volume. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img jydysim9w1961...*

Once again this looks promising for YEXT, as their clients are primarily located in this sect of online business due to accurate data going hand in hand with more online sales. Furthermore, YEXT will be a solid pick for investors in the long term due to its growth along with a growing industry and its solid product. If you are interested in delving deeper into why eCommerce and online payments are growing, be sure to check out the Paypal/Square DD as well.

On their last 10k, Yext reported the following for their most recent compiled income statement:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f8renwobw1961.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d66290b3c437c25c5798b9130d55f3fdbbd25470

As you can see for the top line, there are plenty of positive signs. Revenue has grown by over $50M yearly from 2016 to 2019, and from 2019 to 2020 revenues grew by about $70M. So the indicator when it comes to sales is overwhelmingly signaling that this company is well-positioned to grow, especially in the near future. Gross profit margins are also great as the cost of the product itself isnâ€™t much. The potential issues in the income statement show up as you go toward the bottom line. Operating expenses far outweigh gross profits so net profits are -30% despite gross profit margins being 75%. Breaking down Opex, you can see that about â…” of them go towards sales and marketing, which isnâ€™t necessarily a bad thing as distributing your product can be a huge future investment, but it can be concerning for investors who want a product that â€œsells itselfâ€. Despite this rather arbitrary requirement, the sales growth justifies the spending as itâ€™s obviously working and eventually revenue should far outpace selling expenses. 

In their 10k, they state that their sales expenses primarily had to do with more wages and a higher headcount of employees. As the companyâ€™s operations grow, theyâ€™ll need more employees to run it in an aggressive growth stage. Despite the constant revenue growth, the stock price has been diluted due to more underwriting in 2019. It may take a while to recover from all the extra supply that was brought into the market, but even if we see more financing in early stages, I personally wouldnâ€™t be concerned as thatâ€™s a normal course of action for younger companies.

A quick look at the financials indicates that YEXT is improving as a company over each year. Due to their relatively high amounts of investment, the EPS for the company has remained negative. The EPS was also a lot worse in previous years. However, donâ€™t let this negative metric fool you, as the EPS has been trending positive since the first quarter of 2020. This indicates significant improvement, especially since the EPS hasnâ€™t been improving much prior to 2020. The increase of the EPS is also supported by the increase of change in working capital from $2M to $4M. As for the rest of the cash flow statement, the negative values are primarily caused by the expansion of operations. This expansion of operations is indicated by the increasing total assets, which means that YEXT grew their assets via larger operations. Although the numbers may be negative temporarily, the expansion of operations allows YEXT to generate more revenue from operations and hopefully turn the direction of cash flows around. Constant reinvestment back into the company is a good sign as it indicates owner and shareholder confidence in the future prospect.

Finally, delving into the 10Q provides reassuring prospects for the future health and growth of YEXT as a company. Looking at the breakdown of individual risks, YEXT looks to be relatively secure in the future. The main risks of the company are internal, and are not influenced by factors such as inflation and foreign currency fluctuations. To some, YEXT may appear risky due to its limited financial history and potential unprofitability due to it being relatively new. However, these risks will ultimately be insignificant, as the expansion of operations will soon be recovered by profits if YEXT maintains its current scale of growth that it has achieved in 2020.

In conclusion, YEXT will be a good pickup for many investors because the enterprise solutions industry overall has done very well, and Yextâ€™s solutions are definitely a foray into the future of artificial intelligence combined with traditional SaaS. If you compare Yext to another company that has a similar premise, Twilio, you can see that Yextâ€™s price/sales ratio is only 1/7th of Twilioâ€™s. Of course, Twilio is far more overvalued and has had better sales growth than Yext this past year, but Yext isnâ€™t a slouch in sales growth either as weâ€™ve seen. Plus, they have far more potential than Twilio does as weâ€™ve seen with their relatively small market cap of $2B. Both companies offer AI-based enterprise solutions, but Yext is just as good if not a better solution for the future as it has more applicability through a variety of businesses. If you want to see similar growth to what weâ€™ve seen in companyâ€™s such as Twilio but feel as if youâ€™ve missed the bus, donâ€™t worry: weâ€™ve got the pick for you. Yext is still 25% off its 52-wk high, and they are sure to surpass it with just one or two blowout positive ERs which will be in the books soon."

Fluor Interesting turnaround and growth prospects DD,1609651465,Rjlv6,28," \*\*\*\*\*Please note I own stock in this Company this is not investment advice its just a research dump invest carefully!\*\*\*\*

**Overview** 

Fluor is a Fortune 500 Engineering,Â Procurement and Construction (EPC)Â company headquartered in Irving Texas.Â  Fluor corporation has approximately 45,000 employees worldwide. The company operates in 6 segments, Energy and Chemicals, Mining and Industrial, Infrastructure and Power, Diversified Services, and Other with one additional segment being reported as discontinued operations. 

**Fundamental** **Problems** 

Fluor has multitude of issues that have threatened the very survival of the company. These issues have caused the market cap to crater from 8 Billion in 2018 to 2.25 Billion. The most critical problems are summarized below. This is by no means a complete list. For the sake of length, I have omitted some of the less critical issues. We must also note that there may also be other problems lurking as well. 

* Improper bidding, cost overruns and restructuring have led Fluor to report aÂ 1.5 Billion loss with approximately 300 Million in asset impairments. 
* There are 16 loss contracts that have been improperly negotiated and must be completed at zero margin. 
* Weakness in oil Demand has led Flours customers to reduce capex spending in the Energy &amp; Chemicals segment which comprises 40% of Fluorâ€™sÂ revenue. 
* Fluor has had major accounting problems which have spawned a SEC &amp; DOJ investigation. 

**Liquidity** 

Fluor has $2 Billion in cash, $5 Billion in current assets and $7.2 Billion in total assets. This compares to $3.5 Billion of current liabilities withÂ total liabilities of $6.0 Billion. I believe due to Fluorâ€™s strong cash position they have ample liquidity to meet all their near-term obligations. Furthermore, while substantial I believe their debt is withinÂ reasonable ranges. Fluor is selling an equipment rental business to allow them toÂ â€œModestlyâ€ reduce their leverage and raise more cash, further improving liquidity. 

**How Fluor Is Addressing Their Problems** 

While Fluorâ€™s issues are critical,Â I believe that management is successfully addressing these problems. 

Fluorâ€™s improper contract negotiation stems primarily from their Lump Sum contracts. Essentially this mean that Fluor gets paid in a lump sum at the project completion. This is problematic because it means Fluor must wait until completion of the project before being paid. Additionally, any cost overrun or delay is completely absorbed by Fluor. In order to prevent anymore loss contracts from entering their backlog Fluor has stopped negotiating lump sum contracts opting for more traditional contract negotiation approach and thus protecting the future backlog from more loss contracts. 

Despite a net loss of 1.5 Billion, Fluor has generated operating cash flow of $219 Million with Free Cash Flow of $38 Million. This operating cash flow will continue to give Fluor a buffer to complete their loss projects while even increasing their cash balance. As Fluor finishes these projects their operating cash flow and free cash flow will continue to climb higher.  

The weakness in revenue for Energy and Chemicals should also begin to slow as some EPC work for regular Maintenance is necessary to maintain oil and gas infrastructure. Furthermore,Â if emission standards become stricter this could spur demand as refineries increase CAPEX to upgrade their facilities. Finally, I expect the chemicals portion of this business to continue to drive adequate performance as we do not have any viable alternatives to Petro-Chemicals yet. 

On the accounting side Fluor has unfortunately discovered that there were problems with theirÂ Internal FinancialÂ Controls and revenue recognition. These issues have been corrected but I think it is safe to assume that Fluor has significant liability with potential SEC &amp; DOJ lawsuits.Â However,Â despite this I believe the lawsuits, while expensive, likely will take years to resolve and considering Fluorâ€™s strong cash position theyÂ will most likely will be able to pay the fine. 

**Impact of Reasonable Adverse Development's on Fluor's business** 

In order to establish Safety of principal we must consider a few possible adverse conditions that can arise and the impact on Fluor's business.Â  

* More loss contracts, This would be a very poor outcome for Fluor but I believe that even with more loss contracts Fluor would still generate enough cash to meet all theirÂ obligations. in a worst case scenario Management could also continue to sell more assets in order to raise more capital to fund the loss contracts. 
* Major Global Economic Recession, This would be mostly bad for Fluor but its possible they could actually benefit from fiscal stimulus and projects designed to spur demand in the Economy.  They also have a backlog of projects so a major drop in revenue wouldn't immediately occur in a recession. Rather they would have a little bit of time to figure out what to do.
* Prolonged Depressed Oil Prices, This is a pretty likely scenario thankfully Fluor has expertise in many different industries and can continue to drive growth in these areas. WhileÂ over exposed at the moment they are not solely dependent on Oil and Gas. 

**Major Growth Opportunities** 

These ideas below are the most exciting and compelling reason to look at investing in Fluor. 

Fluorâ€™s Mining &amp; Industrial segment constructs &amp; maintains mines globally. As demand for precious metals increase due to a transition away from fossil fuels, precious metals for batteries could take the place of Oil. This includes lithium, nickel and cobalt Fluor has prior experience with these materials. Mining already comprises about 35% of their revenue and has been profitable and a major pillar of stability in Fluor's business. (Although Covid has Delayed some new contract awards in this segment)

Fluorâ€™s Energy &amp; Chemicals Business has built off shore wind farms, carbon capture, bio-fuels and hydrogen infrastructure. All infrastructure currently being looked at to mitigate or solve the climate change crisis. This area will be competitive but Fluor does have its own IP it can bring to the table and compete with. If there is a major jump in demand in the coming years Fluor is certainly capable of winning some construction work in these areas.

Some other miscellaneous things Fluor engages in is nuclear decommissioning, managing the U.S strategic oil reserve, Building automobile &amp; Pharmaceutical factories and Data center construction. 

And then there is the crown jewelÂ NuScale, a company planning on building the First small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) in the United States. Fluor is the Majority investor in NuScale and is the exclusive EPC contractor for NuScale. Recently the U.S Nuclear Regulatory Commission certified NuScaleâ€™s one-of-a-kind design. The U.S Department of Energy has also awarded NuScaleâ€™sÂ first customer $1.3 Billion in cost sharing to build the first reactor Idaho. Interestingly the United States International Development Finance Corp also lifted a ban for the financing of nuclear projects and has also signed a letter of intent to support NuScale. This will likely be a $1 Billion dollar loan South Africa in order to build a NuScale SMR . There are many other interested parties both inside and outside the U.S including Canada, Romania and the Czech Republic. The applications of this technology are wide ranging. Electricity production is a primary use, however other uses include desalination for clean drinking water and using the excess heat produced by the reactor to create cheap carbon free hydrogen. 

**Basis for Investment** 

In the near term I believe Fluor can successfully complete a turnaround restoring most of their business segments back to reasonable profitability. In 2017 Fluor generated 318 Million in Free Cash Flow. Assuming Fluor completes their restructuring and finishes the loss contracts I see no reason why Fluor cannot return to at least 250 million in annual free cash flow. This FCF is 11% of Fluor's Total market cap and by itself presents a very attractive return for an investor. Simultaneously Fluorâ€™s should be able to shift their construction focus away from oil and gas to newÂ areas that are growing increasingly important. The low barriers to entry are both a blessing and curse in this regard. That brings me to NuScale which oddly seems as though itâ€™s being adopted by the U.S government as some strange foreign policy play. While it remains a longshot in my view the combination of the DOE grant and the potential DFC loan is 2.3 billion a big positive. This is equivalent to the entire market cap of Fluor and shows the scale of the opportunity. Furthermore, Fluor currently has no competitors in this market so margins should be significantly higher. I believe Fluor will complete a successful turnaround likely bringing the stock back to 4 Billion and restoring the dividend. In the Long-term the company could even hit new all-time highs however Iâ€™m not entirely confident on putting an exact figure on that just yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Fluor is struggling construction company, but I think the company can pull off a successful turnaround. That coupled with expanding their existing non-oil revenue and the NuScale wild card could send the stock from $16 to at least $30 and possibly beyond $80 (its all time high) since its a very compelling growth story. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also sorry if there's a lot of awkward phrasing or poor grammar I have a learning disability lol. (actually though)

Even if none of that proves to come to fruition, weâ€™d still have some cause for concern in the general public over the larger Geopolitical environment. 

Thereâ€™s been chatter about a possible Trump victory through the above challenges etc. I feel although this is fucking retarded, placing a wager on this is a +EV spot due to the bottom barrel Cost basis.

&amp;#x200B;

2 days ago while most of us were constantly checking RH even though markets were closed, [Microsoft got hacked.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/31/tech/microsoft-source-code/index.html) These are the same hackers that hacked Solarwinds. It became known a couple weeks ago Did you see what happened to SWI recently? Go check. Down almost 40%.  Now look, I'm no genius, but if Solarwinds got hacked and dropped more than 1/3rd, Microsoft probably isnt gonna be sitting super peachy, is it? To be fair, Microsoft said that only Source Code was viewed, but Solarwinds is literally an IT company based around management and IT Security, and it took months for them to figure out they were hacked. My guess is it's much worse than it sounds, be prepared for a big microsoft dip.

Are stocks overpriced? How much growth is required to justify a P/E of 100?,1609666390,Shayco,6,"In this post, we shall explore how the one- and two-stage Gordon Growth Models, and Dividend Discount Model, relate to growth rates, valuations, earnings, dividends, inflation, and return on investment.

Let E = earnings d = dividend P = price r = discount rate g = (terminal) dividend growth rate

Then y = d/P is the dividend yield Y = E/P is the earnings yield P/E = 1/Y p = d/E is dividend payout ratio

According to the Gordon Growth Model,

y = d/P = r - g.

Hence,

Y = y/p.

So, for example, if r = 10% is the required return, and the growth rate is g = 3%, then dividend yield should be y = 7%.

If also the payout ratio is 70%, then the P/E must be 10. If the payout ratio is p = 100%, then the P/E can be ~14.

It may appear counter-intuitive that higher retention requires a lower P/E. But remember that we are talking about dividend growth rates, g, not earnings growth rates.

So if a firm is able to grow dividends without retaining earnings, this likely means that it benefits from pricing power, protecting from inflation, or that it has conservative accounting.

However, when the dividend is zero, g cannot be measured, and the model breaks down.

So we assume that earnings represent distributable cash, in the sense that if the dividend payout were 100%, the business could sustain constant earnings. And then we consider the situation where a fast-growing company wishes to retain all of its earnings for future growth. However, indefinite growth at a rate higher than the nominal GDP is implausible. And indefinite growth without dividends is, in theory, not worth anything. To be valuable, a company must eventually harvest earnings. Or it must be acquired, and its survivor must harvest earnings. So, consider the situation where a company grows quickly for a period of time and then grows more slowly while paying dividends. For this, we may apply a two-stage Gordon Growth Model, which is really just a special case of the Dividend Discount Model (DDM). For simplicity, assume the initial growth is g, and the payout ratio is zero, for a period of n years, prior to slowing to a (dividend and earnings) terminal growth rate h, and a 100% payout ratio, with dividend d.

The correct price after n years is given by the Gordon Growth Model:

P_n = d / (r - h).

But in order for this price to be achieved in n years, the price today must be,

P_n = d_n / [(r - h) (1 + r)n].

At time n, d_n = E_n, which will have grown:

E_n = E (1 + g)n.

Hence,

P = E (1 + g)n / [(r - h) (1 + r)n]

= [(1 + g) / (1 + r)]n * E / (r - h).

Rearranging, we find,

g = [(1 + r) * [(r - h) (P/E)]1/n - 1] * 100%

Assume, for example, if the discount rate (required return) is r = 10%, and the initial P/E is 100.

If the terminal growth rate is h = 0 after n = 10 years, then the required earnings growth spurt for these 10 years will be g = 38.5% per annum, for a 26-fold increase in earnings. But, after all, r = 10% is a nominal discount rate, a mature company may be expected to grow at a rate of

h = i + G,

where i = inflation rate and G = real GDP growth rate.

So if i = 3% and G = 2%, then, h = 5% may be expected at maturity, with a 100% dividend payout policy.

Reviewing the formula, then, we find the following results for different periods of growth, n, where g = growth rate, and m = E_n / E, the factor by which earnings multiply:

n = 10 years g = 29.2% m = 13 times

n = 15 years g = 22.5% m = 21 times

n = 20 years g = 19.2% m = 34 times

We see then, that a business must sustain approximately 20% earnings growth for 20 years in order for it to justify a current P/E of 100, assuming it matures at year 20. A higher hurdle rate, r, would require more aggressive assumptions about growth, and a lower hurdle rate would require less aggressive growth assumptions. Naturally, growth rates of high-growth companies tend to fall continuously, with size (law of large numbers) and competition. But this is a rough illustration of what is required. One may experiment with the formula using other P/E ratios, etc. Also, the formula does not directly apply to loss-making companies. And, in fact, some loss-making companies can become profitable and grow earnings quickly via operating leverage. $FB is one such example. When it IPO'd in 2012, it was barely profitable. However, it subsequently grew earnings one thousandfold, because revenues rose faster than costs.

Growth rates in the above examples are rare, so forecasting them should be rather difficult."

I grew up spending much of my teenage years in their stores. In fact, I was born in raised in Grapevine, Tx, where they started. But now youâ€™re talking about one of the most poorly managed companies I can think of. GameStop had every opportunity to transition to online sales and theyâ€™ve blown it every step of the way. They have been slowly closing retail stores for years, but itâ€™s been a slow bleeding death. They should have gone all in to online sales years ago. They had the capital and the customer base to pull it off for years and theyâ€™ve done nothing to capitalize on it. They are still committed to trying to make retail stores work and itâ€™s a dying medium. They are the Playboy of porn. Yes, they will probably continue to live out a meager existence for some years, but the idea that they will get back to the top is ludicrous. They are dinosaurs going extinct. Even today as they close a thousand stores, their online marketplace is garbage. I canâ€™t think of the last time Iâ€™ve seen a worse web page from a major company.

Why did PLTR sell off last week? (An analysis),1609679388,notlikethis1994,153,"\# Everybody that wanted in, was already in

According to finviz.com, retail investors own 79% of PLTR's float (shares available for trading), suggesting that much of the price increase from $10 to over $30 in the past 3 months was driven by said class of investors. It's unlikely that risk-sensitive institutions would be heavily involved in such a feverish stock. For example, Palantir's market cap increased by more than $10 billion in a couple days after the announcement of a $44 million 3-year partnership with the FDA. $44 million over 3 years is a rounding error relative to its annual revenue.

After hitting its $33 peak, PLTR pulled back and consolidated at a $25 to $29 price range. During this time, people continue to be bullish for the stock with many believing that it'll soon break all-time-highs again. Unfortunately, at least in the short term, everyone that wanted in was already in and the lack of new buying primed the stock for a sell-off. Another way to spot this is when /r/WallStreetBets starts being filled with bullish commentary for the stock. On a few days in November and December, the majority of the subreddit was talking about PLTR. If you think about it, users would only create a bullish post or upvote bullish posts of a stock if they already had a long position.

Once the buying pressure waned, a small amount of selling compounded with other bearish factors discussed below were sufficient to trigger large waves of selling.

\# Options market makers selling hedged stocks for sold calls

Options market makers are institutions contracted by an exchange to supply liquidity to the options market, even when there's no willing external buyer or seller. Market makers make money by buying or selling options to traders at slightly worse prices than the actual price, and pocketing the difference. As such, they aren't interested in making a directional bet on a stock's price by being short or long options and whenever you sell or buy an option from them, they need to hedge their position.

Specifically, when a market maker sells a call option to a trader, the market maker needs to hedge by buying the underlying stock. When a market maker buys a call option from a trader, the market maker shorts the underlying stock. Vice versa for puts.

PLTR had a large number of open call positions expiring at year-end. As price fell, most of these options expired worthless and the market makers that sold them had to unwind their hedges. Because market makers buy the underlying stock to hedge against a sold call position, they sell said stock when unwinding the hedge. As large numbers of PLTR's call options expired worthless at year-end, options market makers sold the PLTR they bought as a hedge which contributed to the year-end price decline.

\# Institutional funds rebalancing

Even though retail investors own most of Palantir's tradeable shares, institutions do own a non-trivial amount (12% of the float, according to finviz.com) that were mostly acquired during the IPO. These institutions include Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, and Soros Fund Management. Funds have a target ownership percentage for each portfolio stock and when its price increases or decreases dramatically in a short period, the fund needs to rebalance by selling or buying said stock. Rebalancing happens either at a fixed time period or when an imbalance threshold is crossed. Because PLTR's price appreciated so rapidly in just a couple months, it probably fell victim to year-end institutional rebalancing.

\# Frontrunning profit-taking in 2021

Because PLTR's price increased so rapidly in 2020, traders are expected to sell in 2021 to defer taxes for one year. It's likely that some traders attempted to get ahead of this expectation by selling a few days before December 30th (trades executed on and after this date settle in 2021). PLTR's price started to fall off a cliff on December 28th and it kept falling until the year's last trading day on December 31st. As such, the selling on the 28th and 29th is partially attributed to traders frontrunning new-year-profit-taking while the selling on the 30th and 31st is new-year-profit-taking.

\# Frontrunning the 2021 lock-up period expiry

Palantir's IPO was a direct listing meaning that it only made existing shares sellable on the market. No new shares were created and sold. This means that insiders (founders, employees, and VCs) own most of Palantir's shares. During the IPO, these insiders could only sell 20% of their holdings and the other 80% are locked up until after 2021's first earnings report. Unsurprisingly, traders expect more selling than usual when these shares unlock since 80% is a lot of shares. Long time PLTR holders will want to divest at least some of their holdings. It's plausible that, like new-year-profit-taking, traders are selling early to get ahead of the lock-up period ending.

\# Price chart sell signals

Technical analysis (using price charts to determine when to buy or sell) is controversial but still popularly used to predict short term price movements. PLTR's chart displayed several sell signals ever since it peaked at $33. For one, the chart has a giant double top with rejections at $33 and $31 on November 27th and December 8th respectively. A double top is a very popular sell signal. Bullish momentum and volume has also waned since the price peak with daily MACD (a technical indicator) becoming bearish on December 10th. Falling momentum is no bueno for a stock driven by momentum.

1) millennials and everyone else wants more shit but too many are YOLOing it on other shit. So Affirm will give you the chance to buy it today and pay for it upto 6 months later, free money equals tendies, at least thatâ€™s what they want us retards to think. If enough retards fall for it then the late fees could be enough to get some nice WAP tendies.

2) Max Levchin (no clue how to spell that shit) is one of those PayPal autists. You know who else are an PayPal autists? Peter thiel and Elon musk. Enough said as the tendies write themselves

3) my wifeâ€™s boyfriend Tyrone told me he likes affirmâ€™s fundamentals... whatever the fuck that means. But if Tyrone said it then who am I to disbelieve. 

4) I owe affirm a lot of money and if I default then I can collect it back on the IPO cause thatâ€™s how it works.

$MT Technical and Value Analysis,1609688614,GiantGonads,154,"MT is a heavily traded by the institutions and hence follows institutional structures. They like to target the 125%, 150% and 200% swings of balance areas. See how they target the 2x moves areas in the chart below in the Green boxes.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img gzt5snrgx4961...*

For the latest swing we have broken above the previous high at 19 and held and has reacted to the 150% extension line. We now know that the institutions and the algos are working off this swing structure. Their target will be in the upper red box around $29- $30.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 8myexzhgy4961...*

Ideally the best place to buy would be in the green box around $19 however if we do a statistical arbitrage analysis of the stock vs the price of steel, I dont think it will go back this far.

This is a chart of MT vs Steel Futures prices. You can see the stock has a close correlation to steel prices and is trading at a significant discount to the price of steel. The last steel price peak of $900 , MT was trading at an average of $30( purple box area). Steel is now at $1000, so the $30 target is very reasonable.

*Processing img 22msxzrgz4961...*

From current price to $30 is a 30% gain for an initial target. It could blow through this area but I would expect to see some profit taking here and a short term reversal especially if steel prices start to come off. If they dont the institutions will re accumulate for the next leg up. 

I will look to buy at 22.20, 21.20 and around 19 if I see the right volumes coming in."

The stock has fallen 18% in December, 25% since last top, room for growth

Negatives: 

Former support at $18 is broken, and the fall of 15% to $15 is likely if shorts don't start covering in Monday/Tuesday.

15 day MA has moved under 50 day MA, makes the fall more likely

The top triangle pattern has formed over the past 30 days.

Conclusion: Could go either way lmao. After Q2 earnings were beaten, $BBBY rose like 70%. The risk of -15% is not that terrible too. Buy shares not call options, avoid using leverage and everything should work out well.

"Recovery Rebate Credit: If you were claimed as a dependent but paid taxes, you may be still be able to claim $1,200 on your taxes this year.",1609691733,wcamerons,55,"**Good Morning Yâ€™all.**

The other day I was reading the news and saw [this](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wzzm13.com/amp/article/money/first-stimulus-payment-tax-claim/67-c48b059f-0457-4abe-b00d-3748a01cdf1f). Thereâ€™s no rocket or moon emojis so I know none of you will read it. But hereâ€™s the main point:

*â€If a college student worked in 2020 they're still eligible,"" said Greene-Lewis. If the student files their taxes independently for 2020, they can use the Recovery Rebate Credit to get up to $1,200.

Most students are also not eligible for the second stimulus check, so they can also use the credit next year to get $600.â€*

Many of you guys, like me, are claimed as a dependent by your parentsâ€”even if youâ€™re basically living on your own as a college student and file your taxes independently. This meant that when stimulus checks were sent out, you didnâ€™t receive the $1,200 you so desperately wanted to throw at TSLA weeklies. **Thereâ€™s a way that you can get what you deserve.**

The Rebate Recovery credit is a tax credit that 18-24 year old dependents can claim when they file their taxes to get up to $1,200. Remember this when you file this tax season. And, yaâ€™ know, get back at Mitch a little.

Along with the $3,000 in losses youâ€™re gonna claim anyways, you can now also claim the stimmy money this tax season. Now, you wonâ€™t be able to pay back that loan your dad gave you; but, throw your tax refund into enough GME calls, and you may be able to return your account to even.

Can you tell when I started and stopped taking WSB seriously,1609692646,Anoose007,0,
A Cry for Help,1609692662,Hun-chan,8," About five years ago a friend of mine recommended the intelligent investor by Benjamin Graham. The strategy outlined within really resonated with me. I spent my twenties as wandering acetic of sorts, and I never imagined myself playing the stock market, because it seemed like the kind of endeavor reserved for guys who snort blow off of hookerâ€™s tits in the back of lambos. Value investing, on the other hand, seemed to really fit my persona. I mean Iâ€™m the kind of guy who will argue with the green grocer for hours just to get a 10-cent discount on some shriveled turnip, so I figured I might actually have a knack for sniffing out bargains in the equity markets as well. I became more and more eager to dip my toes into stocks, so over the next few years I devoured every bit of literature I could find on the subject, mostly focusing on the works of the greats like Warren Buffet and Ray Dalio, etc. Iâ€™d already been investing in index funds for about 10 years or so, but in July of 2020, I felt like I was finally ready to take the plunge, so I registered for an account with Fidelity and after much consideration I loaded up what I believed to be a pretty-well balanced portfolio that could potentially grow my trifling savings and supplement my paltry income as a freelance translator.   

Fast forward to the present and Iâ€™ve lost about 30% of my initial investment. Thatâ€™s mostly on stonks mind you, because my pee-pee is much too small to bear the weight of leverage and options. I have found that I possess an uncanny ability to buy the peaks and sell the dips. Iâ€™ve done it multiple times over with all manner of stocks. I firmly seize the reigns when they soar to their lofty heights and then ride them down to their absolute troughs, clinging in utter paralysis until queasiness overcomes me and I seek relief by clicking the sell button.

Truth be told, I have also begun dabbling with some contracts here and there. Though I always try to play it safe, sticking to two months out ATM calls, but somehow every time, within moments of clicking the buy button, the trend lines belligerently reverse, as if to spite me. At this point I am 0 for 10 with my options trades. I have never made money â€“ Not. One. Single. Time. 

Allow me to recount one of my most agonizing trades. My misstep involved a company by the name of Sportsmanâ€™s Warehouse. I noticed it was a major holding of Scion Asset Management hand-picked by the OG autist himself Dr. Michael Burry. In mid-October it was trading at about $13/share, giving it a single-digit P/E ratio, amidst peers with valuations nearly double that. The company had reported impressive revenue growth the previous quarter, but much of that income came from bubba wingnuts preemptively scooping up semi-automatic weapons before Paw Biden got a chance to slap a ban on the AR-15. My thesis was that the share price was being punished unduly, and that their diverse revenue streams would buoy the share price in due time. I bought some $13 calls expiring on December 18. I watched over the next two months as the share price continued its jagged downward trajectory and my calls expired worthless. 

â€œThen what happened?â€ 

Well, Iâ€™m glad you asked because, the very next trading day Sportsmanâ€™s Warehouse announces that it will be acquired by Bass Pro, and then, as if to mock me, the chart produced a handsome green fully engorged candlestick about 40% taller than my strike price.

On another occasion I followed a hot tip on WSB and bought ATM calls on Atlas Air Worldwide about a week before Congress requested that they to return 630 million dollars granted to them as part of the Payroll Support Program, and the share price tanked. 

I was also intrigued by BMC Holdings, a home builder with an ingenious system of flat-pack framing that saved contractors money in labor costs and disposal fees. True to form I rode that one sideways for a few weeks, eventually got bored, and sold it to break even, only to see it moon days later on news of acquisition by a larger rival. 

Perhaps the most tragic blunder in my short stint as a trader concerns our beloved GME. I first learned of the GME deep value proposition on this sub in July, and I watched timidly from the sidelines until the share price was sufficiently elevated for my entry. This was probably the closest thing I had ever done to a YOLO. I bought $8,000 worth of shares in late September for 10.98 and held steadfast until October 8 by which time it had declined almost 20%. At about 12:30 pm on that fateful day I decided to cut my losses to the sum of $1,600, cursing the name of the WSB autist who had led me into this ill-conceived trade. I could almost feel the sulci furrowing into my smooth brain as I made up my mind to click the sell button. Henceforth, I would think for myself. Never again would I be led astray by â€œstock tipsâ€ from strangers on the internet, be they the incoherent ravings of a WSB degenerate or the prudent advice of a WSJ sage. I summoned up my reserves of discipline, stood up, and walked away from the trading desk. Well, I suppose we all know what happened about an hour and a half later. GME achieved lift off, propelled by news of the Microsoft partnership and I was left admiring its celestial flight from my decidedly terrestrial vantage point. 

The other day I decided to do a little back-testing, thinking that it might provide some insight into what I have been doing wrong. I plugged in all of the tickers from the portfolio I picked back on day 1 and I found that if I had simply diamond-handed those bitches I would be up like over 100% within the past 6 months. That first day of my foray into investing I had the good sense to buy stuff like NIO, BILI, AMD, and BMCH, and I had every intention of holding them forever, but then I found this sub and decided to try some more â€œadvancedâ€ strategies.

Now I scan my watchlist and notice how every single ticker has just kept bouncing along higher and higher. It seems, so inconceivable that my account balance has followed the opposite trajectory. How could this happen? What went wrong? I managed to lose money buying stocks in one of the biggest bull markets in history. My timing was so impeccable. I was somehow able to enter even stocks with tremendous upward momentum and exit just after a major correction. I am a true prodigy at buying high and selling low. It occurs to me (as it must to all shitty traders) that if I had simply taken a short position on all of those trades, I would have actually tucked away a 30% gain. Have I just been fooling myself into feigned bullishness all along? Was I born to be a bear?

$PETS petmed express undervalued if you believe the business will persevere!,1609693690,ArcticGold,6,"I'm not even sure I'm allowed to post this just simply due to the fact it's not a 1B market cap.

Pros: It sells pets meds since two decades ago. No long term debt  $100+ million in cash. Gives out like $1.00+ in dividend/year.

Market cap is 650M simply because ppl no longer think there's future potential.

PETS is holding pretty well by itself but probably better if some big mamba can acquire it whole.

It has the licenses to send drugs all over the US and Canada.

Cons: Chewy started off their own pet pharmacy in 2018.
Walmart and Amazon kinda did as well. Chewy is still losing money but wallstreet is pricing them as a strong growth company. Not sure why Chewy didn't just spent $1 billion and incorporated petmed express in 2018.

1800-petmeds website looks like a website in the 1990's.

Short story: good undervalued stock that gives a dividend. Hopefully Amazon would throw their 2 pennies at it and just acquire petmed express. Easy to enter the pet market with a good track record and petmed express wouldn't need to use their crappy website anymore."

Lessons from 2020,1609696262,_WinnerTakesAll_,33,"Hi All, 

I debated if I should make this post but I thought it might help one or two new kids who are new to investing. If you think it's useless down vote it and I will delete it. 

At the beginning of 2020 I  was just like most of you was not a member of WSBs and invested on my own accord. All that changed in February. I opened an active trading account for fun. I joined reddit and figured I should get involved with the community so that we make money together. Here are the lessons that I think would help some of newer guys than me. Also here is my performance in my speculative account which was opened in March 2020:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w762xt6805961.png?width=890&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f227bc450c381543cb098dd12cfeb3f1f1a1aebd

**Lesson 1: Consistency Matters**

My goal with this speculative account was to try different strategies but get consistent returns nonetheless. I aimed to not have any down months. This helps alleviate the mental anguish caused by roller-coaster-type portfolios. As my mama told me 5 years ago, you are playing with hard-earned-money. This is why I stayed away from YOLOing the whole account on few select plays. I aimed to have many different bets going on at the same time. 

**Lesson 2: Helping others is harder than earning money.**

My dad opened a speculation account at the same in March. I decided that I would help him have a similar performance as mine. I kept on feeding him info about my trades. What did he do? Most of the times he thought I was retarded and called the local hospital for me. When Boeing dropped to $93, I was on the phone telling him this is free money. I told him to by $30k but he just bought $10k. I was buying American Airlines on the same day. This story repeated many times over the last 9 month. I think at the end he managed to scratch of \~250%. Now I have him on a conservative buy and hold strategy since he is not cut out to actively trade. And by actively I mean 4 trades a week for him. 

**Lesson 3: Having a good broker is important**

If you haven't deleted Robinhood and gotten your self a proper broker after you hearing or experiencing bugs, crashes, service outages, your data being sold, .... then I don't know if I can convince you. Other brokers will give you access to ADRs and allow you invest in some bigger European companies that are trading OTC here. 

**Lesson 4: Don't argue with people; instead discuss ideas.**

If you notice someone is arguing instead of discussing ideas with you then just ignore them. For every seller of a stock there is a buyer. There is no point in personally attacking people. If you believe strongly that they are wrong, then just inverse their trade. Respect and thank them for sharing their trades with you, even if you disagree with them.

**Lesson 5: Media is a hype machine**

CNBC, Bloomberg, ... are all in the business of creating excitement and increasing their viewership. They are not there to enhance your returns. What gets people's attention is usually not a good investment. 

**Lesson 6: Reddit slaps you harder than a twisted tea**

I used to share ALL my DDs here. Sharing is caring, right? apparently not. There was no shortage of personal attacks, being banned, DDs being deleted, ... My Karma even dropped to -1k in March. I am permanently banned from r/ investing, economics, .... I got temporary banned here, and two other investing subs. So I post less DDs now, and don't try to stop people from jumping from rooftops. 

**Lesson 7: Most popular posts/users should not be blindly mimicked**

Most people including me already know this, but I keep seeing it here. I figured I should mention it since I have your attention. When you see a trade that is getting a lot of attention ask yourself: does this fit my strategy? If not then don't do it. What is strategy you ask? oh boy

**Lesson 8: Don't let survivor bias fool you**

Everyday people on WSB are throwing millions of dollars on thousands of small bets. The odds are some of them are gonna pay of. So when you see some guy posting Gain-porn of 1k turning to 100k overnight. Remember that over night thousands of other people with similar bets lost it all. So don't just follow people blindly. Some of the most respected guys here are essentially doing the same thing by YOLOing all their money on one bet that unfolds over several month. These guys last longer but essentially are playing few bets game. When you roll the dice 5 times the odds of you getting 5 in a row is a lot. There is a reason we don't hear from YungBillionaire anymore. Please don't Yolo your whole account on GME, Palantir, and such. 

**Lesson 9: Moderation on reddit is skewing the information you see**

It's hard to be an unpaid moderator on reddit. So more power to them. I have to say u/zjz is one of the best I've seen.... When a post has to clear the personal point of view of 10 moderators on each sub, you end up with what in the industry is known as committee results; ie neutered and already priced in. Usually 1/3 of my posts make it through the mod filter so I am posting less and less every day. Sometimes I discuss a post with a mod and make it acceptable to him and then another one comes and bans me for 3 days for a DD with 90% upvote. lol

**Lesson 10: When the tide goes out you realize who was swimming naked.**  

Popularized by WB, he wasn't the one who came up with it. When a correction happens, and I guarantee you there will be a correction, then you realize who was blindly chasing alpha without any risk management. The correction may not come for a few years but there always is a correction, pullback for some random reason. So **manage your risk.** Guh

**Lesson 11: unless you have insider info do not buy weekly or even monthly options.**

LEAPs are risky as well but can be managed. Most people here should not take the weekly or monthly option risk. You need years of experience before doing so. 

**Lesson 12: Paper accounts don't count.**

You need real money to be at risk so that you care and go through the emotions. I never had a paper account and if you are using one, in my opinion you are wasting your time. 

**Lesson 13: No one has a magic sauce.** 

Those who pretend to do are delusional. There is no such thing as ""always do this and you will win"". Market changes and strategies that work now will not work in 2 month. If a guru says buy x, y and z and you will make money, that's total BS.  

**Lesson 14: If you get money help yourself and your family**

You have the option Yoloing your money on weeklys, buy coke, or elevating your life. Money truly brings happiness. Only people who don't have it think that it does not; and site a bs study. Use your money to help your family at key points in their lives. Help with their Mortgage down payment, buy a car for the ones who really need them,... Use your money to work less and work out more. Yolo in real life, not on options. 

**Lesson 15: If you don't invest with conviction, you won't get the results that matter**

You have to know why you are buying some stock and why you would sell it. A lot of winning trades will go against you before they go green. To hold those positions when deep in the red, you gotta have conviction in your thesis. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not going to edit this post because it will mess up it's format. I am going to put a comment below with updates/corrections. Also do NOT message me personally. I don't have a magic sauce."

Heâ€™s a an absolute GOD of DD. He had written this all the way back in OCTOBER. Without further intro, hereâ€™s a bunch of awesome DD. TL;DR: PLTR to the fucking ðŸŒ ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€


*Profitability*

Price to sales is high, coming in at 15.63. Compared to some of their competitors (listed below), the average for the industry is below 2. Said differently, investors are paying a high premium for the rapid growth in revenue and the hope that the industry will explode someday. The key questions are will the AI industry expand and how much of this market will be funneled into Palantir, both commercially and from the government. 

Their revenue is growing quickly. Over the past year it has grown 21.27% and over the prior three years it has a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.83%.

Cash flow and net income are both negative, but they are improving. Their net income has increased by 20% over the past year and their free cash flow has increased by 64.41%. 

Net profit margins are also still negative, but increased 32.63% over the prior year. One thing about their margins is that they definitely live a lavish life style at their workplace. The food is free, the equipment is expensive, and the amenities are abundantâ€”having observed this, they absolutely attract some of the best employees around. 

A nice segway into the balance sheet is to talk about their accounts receivable (A/R). Their ability to collect money consistently and accurately are impressive, with only $5 million in A/R for this year and only $2 million in A/R last year. 

*Balance Sheet*

The company has a book value of $791.47 million and sells at a P/B of ~21.10. This is high for a traditional value or growth play, but is not absurd for technology companies.

Their current and quick ratio are 2.78 and 2.65, respectively. This is impressiveâ€”for safety, a rule of thumb I use is a current ratio above 1.5 and a quick ratio above 1. Anything over 2 ensures a high probability of survival during difficult times. Also, the company barely has any money tied up in restricted cash, allowing them to allocate money to working capital more easily and preventing liquidity crises. But it is not as rosy as it seems. I will talk about the preferred securities shortly. 

The company has $1.08 billion in short-term cash and cash equivalents. Their short-term (&gt; 1 year) liabilities are $730 million and their total liabilities are $3.57 billion. The D/E ratio is impressive, hovering around .39. The larger contractors usually have a D/E ratio above 1-1.5, with the exception of Raytheon. 

One thing that is not shown in the D/E ratio is something I mentioned in a prior paragraph, the preferred stock. This is a problem because preferred shares act very similar to debt. They currently have $2.13 billion in preferred shares outstanding, and I am not sure how many of those are convertible. If we add that to the debt, their new D/E ratio is over 2, putting it higher than most defense contractors. 

*Compensation / Dilution*

Currently, the company has $1.6 billion shares outstanding from their direct listing. On top of that, they have approximately 2.17 billion diluted shares. Said differently, if all options and convertible securities are activated, that is the potential number of shares outstanding. For any company this is an extreme amount of dilution and something Warren Buffet warns value investors about. The engineers and executives are highly compensated through their 250 million+ stock option program, as well as the preferred security holders. 

*Insider Selling*

One thing we never like to see is insider selling. The CEO has sold 11% of his stake, or 14.1 million shares, for $135 million. Cofounder Peter Thiel sold even more, ~$365 million. Nonetheless, the CEO still has the majority of his holdings and will be issued more stock if the company reaches goals in the future. This is something I am not too excited about, but it is not a major red flag because it was a small amount and perhaps he just wanted some cashâ€”he has been working hard for 17 years awaiting this day. 

*Competitors*

When it comes to direct competitors (contractors that specialize in AI), it appears that Leidos, Raytheon, and FireEye stand out the most. However, looking at the defense contracting industry as a whole, Lockheed, Boeing, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman also present threats. Interestingly, there are arguments online that Palantir is extra risky because ~half of their revenue comes from US Government contracts, but this is a common characteristic for many of the defense contractors that I listed above, even Boeing. 

*Valuation*

I will base my valuation on them staying negative cash flow in the coming three years then netting X amount of cash flow for a few scenarios. I can send you the excel document if you want. I will summarize below. My discount rate is 8% (which is high, but conservative) and my growth rate is 7% (which is also somewhat optimistic). 

When it comes to cash flow, I have estimated they will stay negative for three years then slowly work up to $100 million. I will assign different values to their perpetual cash flow after 10 years below keeping the growth rate and discount rate the same. Two major things can happen to mess up the calculations. The growth rate could be higher or lower and the amount of cash flow could be higher or lower.  

Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $100 million annually: $10.9 billion
Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $150 million annually: $16.263 billion
Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $200 million annually: $21.613 billion
Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $250 million annually: $26.963 billion
Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $300 million annually: $32.213 billion
Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $350 million annually: $37.663 billion

Itâ€™s difficult to value a company that is in such an early stage based off cash flow. We have no idea how much cash flow they will bring in, how much the industry will grow, or where interest rates will be. Nonetheless, doing this analysis is sobering and dampens expectations. 

*Other Topics*

Their recruiting and the quality of engineers and computer scientists are similar to that of Tesla. People in the industry know this is a difficult company to work for. Their interviewing process is unique and difficult, usually encompassing a difficult task using their software (i.e. here is a bunch of data; find the terrorist using Gotham). 

Another interesting thing to look at is a top-down, or macro, approach to the industry. 

Here are some interesting points:
1. The US military budget is ~$689.6 billion, and this will likely increase or stay the same in the future
2. AI accounted for ~$4 billion of this budget
3. Cyber security accounted for ~$9.85 billion 
4. Palantir receives approximately half their revenue from government contracts, which is ~$500 million

Letâ€™s assume that the combined budget for AI and cybersecurity grows to $20 billion ($5 billion higher than it is now) in the future, which I think is reasonable. If Palantir is one of the leaders in this industry and accumulate 5% of that $20 billion budget, that would be $1 billion from government contracts, not including their fast growth in the commercial industry. These numbers are conservative, as I think the allocation for AI and cyber could be closer to $50-$100 billion someday. This is where the opportunity is and the commercial side is just icing on the cake. 

If Palantir becomes the leader and the world trends more to cybersecurity and AI, there is potential to make money. 

Finally, I would like to speak about my personal experience with the company. I have used many intelligence tools, but only two stand out to me. Palantir is one of them and it is a cut above its peers. The beauty, capability, and analysis tools are unmatched. It is user-friendly but I wouldnâ€™t say anyone on the street could stand up and use it. I am not sure their plans, but they could modify it and use it for so many applications in the business world. This is something I hope they do.

[Hoarding Collection 2](https://ibb.co/WcJxyjc)

1) Iâ€™m torn - I may not play this at all, but decided to provide some light for those who may want to. Itâ€™s probably because I hate BBBY after seeing how much my GF hordes this crap. 

1.5) **They have an extremely loose return policy** Seems like anything can be returned and exchanged at anytime. 

2) Every year Iâ€™ve had to buy $250-$300 worth of products as part of her Christmas gift during their Candle Day sale. Judging from the other guys there, seems to be the same. 

3) These people will come camp out and wait in line before 6 AM to make sure they get the products they want. 

4) Thereâ€™s always sales going on, and I swear I feel like thereâ€™s at least 4 candle day sales per year...

5) With all these sales, specials and coupons, the margins have to be good on their products...but there are a ton of things that eat into it, ie returns at any time even on used products and 6 below. 

6) Anytime they ship, thereâ€™s more than likely a few broken Candles. Which means getting credit back and exchanging etc. 

7) Women flip these like crazy. They have trade groups, sellers / scalpers getting in on limited scents etc and reselling them. 

8) My GF clearly hordes these...despite constantly burning 2-3 of them, thereâ€™s is a ridiculous amount of supply that is never going down. So the supply coming in is offsetting the usage of them. 

9) Sadly she can liquidate these easily for great profits, but she doesnâ€™t. 


#TL;DR:

GF hordes a ridiculous collection. Women go crazy over their products. Store accepts returns and exchange policy is looser than a college sloot."

[Hoarding Collection 2](https://ibb.co/YNfwQxd)

1) Iâ€™m torn - I may not play this at all, but decided to provide some light for those who may want to. Itâ€™s probably because I hate BBBY after seeing how much my GF hordes this crap. 

1.5) **They have an extremely loose return policy** Seems like anything can be returned and exchanged at anytime. 

2) Every year Iâ€™ve had to buy $250-$300 worth of products as part of her Christmas gift during their Candle Day sale. Judging from the other guys there, seems to be the same. 

3) These people will come camp out and wait in line before 6 AM to make sure they get the products they want. 

4) Thereâ€™s always sales going on, and I swear I feel like thereâ€™s at least 4 candle day sales per year...

5) With all these sales, specials and coupons, the margins have to be good on their products...but there are a ton of things that eat into it, ie returns at any time even on used products and 6 below. 

6) Anytime they ship, thereâ€™s more than likely a few broken Candles. Which means getting credit back and exchanging etc. 

7) Women flip these like crazy. They have trade groups, sellers / scalpers getting in on limited scents etc and reselling them. 

8) My GF clearly hordes these...despite constantly burning 2-3 of them, thereâ€™s is a ridiculous amount of supply that is never going down. So the supply coming in is offsetting the usage of them. 

9) Sadly she can liquidate these easily for great profits, but she doesnâ€™t. 


#TL;DR:

GF hordes a ridiculous collection. Women go crazy over their products. Store accepts returns and exchange policy is looser than a college sloot."
"A look at 2020's wildest streaks (i.e. back to back moonings!) + answering the question: If a stock has been going up for N days already, what's the probability that it will keep going up?",1609702666,maxfort86,30,"As the self-appointed WSB quant, I took it upon myself to look at 2020 data to find the most extreme consecutive moves up and down for stocks. I'm also going to provide a simple analysis that answers the question ""If stock A has been going up for N days already, what's the probability that  it will keep going up in upcoming day(s)?""

First, I define a stock's daily return in a given day as the percentage change in the price from the previous day's close to that day's close.

Second, I limit the analysis only to [Robinhood's 100 most popular stocks](https://robinhood.com/collections/100-most-popular), because that list includes most of the meme/fun stocks.

Third, I only look at April 2020 onward, because after COVID the market has changed significantly and we are still in this new structure.

# Back-to-Back Positive Moves of Any Size

Let's first look at consecutive positive moves. I don't care if the daily return was +50% or +0.001%, as long as it's above zero and happens back-to-back, we count it.

The largest streak belongs to TWTR, WKHS, and ZNGA, with 11 days! After that is TSLA, SNE, and G-U-S-H with 10 days.

Here are how often each streak happened across all stocks in the sample. For example, streaks of 6 happened 91 times (3.8%) for the stocks in the sample.

[Upstreaks Frequency](https://preview.redd.it/17bnpyao56961.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba0ce56d1c82305ca93d6e6552ffceb8e5129353)

Now, back to the question: if a stock has had a streak of N days already, what's the chance that it will keep going up the next day(s)? For the more statistically literate, P(X &gt; N | X = N). I use the table above and Bayes rule to answer this question:

[Probabilities of a streak continuing given its current length](https://preview.redd.it/1uu3rmot56961.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6a1601ff8260fc1d71e211dd079634da87392b3)

*Of course, these probabilities are for all of the stocks in the sample, and they don't take into account the specific conditions of a stock or the events/rumors/news that might have caused the streak to start.*

&amp;#x200B;

# Back-to-Back Positive Moves of at least 3%

Now let's repeat the above analysis but make it more interesting by focusing only on streaks that involved at least a 3% upside move.

The record here belongs to FCEL, which went up 3%+ for 7 days in a row! During this streak, the price of FCEL went from 2.56 to 8.55!

https://preview.redd.it/f5oe2bp566961.png?width=766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cacf785d1b029a5137e7aeec9ea9bb57a5221b7

Similarly, the probability of seeing a 3%+ move in the upcoming day(s) if you already had such a streak for N days:

*Processing img slrjjqy666961...*

# Back-to-Back Negative Moves of any size

Now let's look at the unlucky stocks that went down for consecutive days. Here the record-breaker is XOM, with 11 days of going south. Must've felt terrible if you held the stock during that period.

https://preview.redd.it/pxe9kjg966961.png?width=876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=faa6f74e63503daa0ec7dca8ebbb23e5eba10790

And probabilities of a downstream continuing

And lastly

# Back-to-Back Negative Moves of At Least 3%

The record here belongs to I-D-E-X, with 6 days in a row of going to hell! During this time, the price fell from 0.97 to 0.68.

How often such down streaks happened:

Electricity. 

With California and most of the PNW being on the PG&amp;E grid and being a large chunk of the US population $PCG is INCREDIBLY undervalued as a stock. Theyâ€™ve had some hiccups in the last couple years, and theyâ€™ve obviously learned from them because theyâ€™re still around. They canâ€™t get rid of the entire electrical grid of the west coast and they donâ€™t dare break it up during a pandemic because of the cost of such a move. $PCG is going into the new year with no new major fires in 2021, new leadership and new found reliability based purely on my own experience. 

Now to boring shit.
Balance sheets are looking good post settlement and the company is more than able to recover 100% in short order. With that being said they are going to be the largest energy market in the US, so itâ€™s about time we get while we can, the next few days should be WILD.

It would print roughly 1000-2000% &amp; w/ IV kicking in; way more if we stay on the same track as the last two weeks and repeat a Georgia win.

Engagement Rings: what's the better investment? (Earth or Lab),1609707629,calmsquash515,84,"I know this isn't really wall street but to be fair this sub seemingly has no rules 

I'm contemplating engagement rings and the question is: lab or earth diamond 

Strictly financially speaking the way I see it is you're looking at roughly for a 2ct diamond either $10k for lab or $25k for real. 

Now, the argument that any real diamond jeweler will make to you is: investment. You can resell it, it'll retain value, you can pass it down, etc etc. The lab diamond price will only go down, it will be worth less in 20 years. 

Okay but... What kind of investment is a $25k ring if it'll be worth $25k in 20 years? My thoughts are revolving around the fact that if I took the $15k savings and invested that - conservatively at 6% - I would make $33k gains after 20 years 

I feel like at this point emotion is the only thing that could away a decision here - which I know wsb has a lot of - so what is the investment decision here?"

"Ten(die) Traits of the TENBAGGER ($PLTR, $RKT, $TSLA)",1609707694,LN-beanzo,88," Fellow smooth brains, broke boiz, and gainz girls,

I've had a lot of down time this week since I'm cooped up in q-tine with the vid. Figured I'd change it up and spend time to listen and read about people who actually made money in the markets, instead of edging to EOY loss porn for 10 days straight.

I found a few different hedge fund daddies to keep me company during the alt reality of rona isolation. These dudes weren't smooth brain; they read books and wrote them too. They made all their tendies in the pre-dawn era before the internet, but a lot of their concepts are the foundations of today's DD flair.

One of these hedge fund daddies is Peter Lynch; the silver fox averaged 30% returns over 13 years as manager of Fidelity's Magellan Fund. He frequently &amp; routinely states ""Stonks only go up"" and ""Buy the FKN DIP"" in pre-internet era interviews and he's got a rager for the market advantages of individuals (retail, us, idiots) vs. wall street (chads, citron, warren buffet). He actually walked away from Wall Street at relatively young age to spend more time with his family. This decision can only be interpreted one way; he made enough tendies to send his wife's boyfriend back to instructing $PTON classes and preying on other men's wives. For this, the legacy of he Silver Fox must be immortalized - he is legend.

Anyway, Lynch is pretty famous for coining the characteristics (traits) of a ten bagger. Since I've got lots of time and there's no loss porn on the weekends, I thought it would be an interesting idea to back test some of these ideas on WSB favorites &amp; active bag holders like $RKT, $PLTR, and $TSLA.

**10 Traits of a Ten Bagger:**

**1. Name is Dull or Ridiculous: All tickers check.**

Â· Red $RKT? Sheesh dude calm down.

Â· $PLTR? Fool of a took!

Â· $TSLA? That socialist electrician?

**2. It does something dull: All tickers check.**

Â· $RKT: Mortgage loan processing.

Â· $PLTR: Data aggregation &amp; integration. wut?

Â· $TSLA: Sells cars.

**3. It Does something disagreeable: All tickers check.**

Â· $RKT: Online loan processing is perceived as untrustworthy by institutions &amp; individuals.

Â· $PLTR: Blah blah blah oppression, NSA &amp; data privacy

Â· $TSLA: ""There will never be a market for EVs!""

**4. Institutions don't own &amp; analysts don't follow: Only $PLTR checks.**

Â· $RKT: 15 analysts have coverage with an avg. PT of $24.7

Â· $PLTR: 7 analysts have coverage with an avg. PT of $15

Â· $TSLA: Everyone talkin' TSLA these days. Irrelevant.

**5. It's depressing: All 3 tickers check with some massaging of the interpretation.**

Â· $RKT: When I grew up, home loan refinancing was a bad thing borne from necessity. Exchanging equity for better loan terms prolongs payments and adds long-term interest. These improve affordability and increase in popularity with each recession.

Â· $PLTR: Literally sells system solutions for crisis situations. Think COVID/Conflict/Fraud.

Â· $TSLA: The narrative sells because the climate crisis is the defining issue of our age.

**6. The industry isn't growing: All 3 check with some massaging of the interpretation.**

Â· $RKT: Growth is not the same as appreciation. The housing market continues to spike in part because of archaic housing &amp; city planning policies that prevent new supply from entering markets.

Â· $PLTR: New data points &amp; software solutions continue to be introduced &amp; sold, but PLTR is unique in it's integration &amp; aggregation capabilities. Nobody else is selling this particular solution; in fact, PLTR views their biggest competition as a companies' desire to internalize this solution.

Â· $TSLA: EVs sales are in fact growing exponentially, however the sales are pulling demand from the existing market share of the automobile industry, not creating new market share. Additionally, modern transportation policy ***likely*** reduces the amount of new cars on the road as EVs are increasingly exposed as an edge case for addressing climate change. Also, ARK (momma Wood) has done a bunch of research re: the pending used-car bubble that will put further ownership equity pressure on loans, dealers, and individuals still buying used ICE cars. The combined pressures of costs associated with personal vehicle ownership, rapid asset depreciation, autonomous ride hailing, modern transpo plans focused on decreased congestion &amp; emissions, will significantly reduce the size of this industry in the near/mid term future.

o P.S. I &lt;3 Pete Bootycheeks, US Transpo Sec. Build all the rails &amp; bike lanes.

**7. It's got a NICHE: All 3 check.**

Â· $RKT: mobile loan processing. Speed speed speed. Ease ease ease. Cheese cheese cheese. $RKT's solutions saves time, better prepare buyers &amp; refinancers, simplifies the process, and reduces monthly expense. Rock solid like my $RKT in the mornings.

Â· $PLTR: how many of you work at a fortune 500 (not Wendyâ€™s) that requires you to query data for routine reports? How many logins do you have? how many systems do you need to navigate? Do you know how your co addresses this? They pay managers who can't write =sumif() excel functions, to piece together PowerPoints and workflow diagrams that communicate system enhancements to $100k+ soft devs and system architects who then Frankenstein together 10+ paid SAAS ""solutions"" in 1-3 years. $PLTR comes in hot and ready like the domineos pizza pie delivery guy ready to feed &amp; seed the shmeat lovers. $PLTR works with what you got, growers and showers, to create a highly scalable 2 way data integration &amp; aggregation system in hours.

Â· $TSLA: Battery &amp; self driving tech are the biggest niches at this point, but don't sleep on those EV credits. Wall street industry idiots are salty that $TSLA can improve margins by selling polluter permission slips to allow polluters to pollute, but co's love to pollute so those things print.

**8. Recurring Revenues: All 3 check.**

Â· $RKT: Definition of ""Recurring"": ""occurring again periodically or repeatedly."" $RKT reports a lot of money each quarter's earnings reports. Don't @ me.

Â· $PLTR: the business model is designed to scale billing in tandem with gains made from solution utility.

Â· $TSLA: At this stage, car sales are growing and we haven't hit an extended downturn in the cyclical environment. Just wait till the FSD, energy credits, insurance, ride hailing, and grid energy revenues print infinitely and indefinitely. Anticipate unrealized earnings &amp; receivables to pace with earnings growth.

**-(9. Insiders are buying: $RKT &amp; $TSLA check.**

Â· $RKT: Daddy Dan Gilbert &amp; Juicy Jay Farner were loading up on shares &lt; $20 in August

Â· $PLTR: Mithril (a Papa Thiel fund) got clearance to buy an s-ton of $PLTR at some point last week. Basically, a buy back, but we'll see more when the lock-up period ends.

Â· $TSLA: Denholym sold 43k shares at \~$400 per, but Emperor Elon is diamond handing his market cap option tranches which counts IMO.

**-(10. Its buying back shares: $RKT &amp; $PLTR check.**

Â· $RKT: Announced a completed $1B buyback on the last earnings call

Â· $PLTR: Momma Wood (ARK) has been adding $1m+ in shares each week, but it basically just went public so too early for this.

Â· $TSLA: Issuing new funds to improve cash positions at elevated market cap.

Positions:

Buy the dip, LONG $RKT &amp; $PLTR until $75b market cap, then readjust thesis. $TSLA to $1T market cap, then pivot into 2% divvie stocks till' I transcend into a Silver Fox incarnate.

Why doesn't G B T C ever get mentioned here? Here's why I like it...,1609709261,MrFiveInchTaint,11,"G B T C seems like a decent play to me here. I know it's better to buy B T C direct as there's no mgmt fee or premium, but here's why G B T C makes sense IMO:

* On a macro sense B T C is on a tear and institutional adoption is at an all-time high. Microstrategy in for $500mm, old line insurance company Mass Mutual in for $100mm, Guggenheim recently amended docs to allow up to $500mm of G B T C in its funds and Elon himself tweeted recently about putting some of his companies' money in B T C. My personal target for B T C in 2021 is $50k as 2021 is the year institutions finally feel it's acceptable to hold  B  T C
* B T C is a pain in the ass to buy for Boomers and raises major custody issues for institutions - two of the deepest pockets in the market. G B T C solves both of these issues as institutional ownership of B T C becomes more acceptable and dollar is devalued
* There are currently no pure play B T C ETFs. Van Eck applied for one last week but will face an uphill battle. Likely will need a new SEC commissioner amenable to B T C \*and\* show something different than the companies whose ETF proposals were already rejected. This will take months
* But MrFiveInchTaint, what happens when an ETF is eventually approved - won't G B TC premium disappear? Yeah, probably -- I'm also betting that B TC would run like TSLA before S&amp;P inclusion and offset any premium erosion

Potential catalysts for G B TC this year are continued institutional adoption, a Dem Senate sweep in GA and the $10b of spending that comes with it and even if that doesn't happen, stimulus package 3.0 that's inevitable in the spring.

Georgia Senate Election - POV requested,1609709331,XD1234444,11,"Hi WSB,

I am reaching out to you as a non American to get some answers (serious ones) on what would a democratic senate win most likely mean to the stock market? 

Question 1: On one hand - I heard that if republican wins it's better for companies; on the flip side if Dems win more stimulus very soon. Is that in general true? Do you agree with what I am hearing / reading?

Question 2: will there be any particular sectors benefitting from a Democrat win? e.g. Cannabis, Solar/Alternative energy? How true is that? Alternatively, will there be any sector that will be impacted negatively?

Question 3: I have these current holdings: RKT, NIO, APHA, TLRY, NOV, BABA, WBA, NOK, BBBY, DBX, KMI. Do you see any particular red flag with any of these in case Democrats win?

Thank you so much in advance for helping out!"

Why I YOLOâ€™d 10k into weekly weed stocks options (DD),1609709367,AliensStoleMyLizard,6,"Sup retards. I hear you autistic fucks like yer trendies huh? Well, I got a new one for you that a lot of you probably wonâ€™t like, but fuck it, donâ€™t say I didnâ€™t tell you so. With some thorough research, and a little bit of personal opinion, I am 100% confident that weed stocks are the move for this week and the rest of 2021 ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ 

Better buckle up for 2021.... and hereâ€™s why:

If any of you stupid fucks have been watching the Georgia senate polls, youâ€™ll notice that the democrats have been slowly catching up to the republicans, and are now LEADING according to todayâ€™s polls. Now, I know what youâ€™re thinking, â€œtHe PoLlS aRe NeVeR rIgHt!!â€ Well yes, I agree, polls are fucking stupid to go off of based on the massive amounts of incorrect polls weâ€™ve received in the past. HOWEVER, according to the results from the recent early voting, the demographic heavily favors the Democratic Party. In the original 2020 senate election, there were about 4m votes, and thereâ€™s 3m in the early voting. Thatâ€™s insane considering there has never been this amount of votes for early voting in a senate runoff EVER. In large democratic counties, such as DeKalb and Fulton County, that favor democrats, early voter turnout is incredibly high. The median amount of registered voters who early voted for larger counties was approximately 62%, while the smaller conservative counties clocked in at 58%. And as we know, African Americans voted for 89% for democrats but white Americans only accounted for about 68% of republicans votes. This is great news for democrats as this means there is a high turnout for them in these large counties. It also seems like Republican voters are more willing to sit out of this election as President Donald trump has called out rigging of elections, as well as Kelly Loeffler showing constant support for Trump could hurt her chances of re-election. As of today, Jon Ossoff leads Perdue by 1.8%, while Raphael Warnock leads by 2.2%.

Not only do the polls suggest democrats are ahead, but retarded gamblers such as ourselves are starting to bet on a democratic majority.

You bitches are about to bust so many god damn nuts. According to PredictIt.com, betters are majority in favor of BOTH democratic candidates. Yesterday, Warnock was leading Loeffler .57c to .45c. NOW, Warnock has a huge lead with .60c to Loefllers .43c. Ossoff is LEADING NOW too with .52c to Perdues .51c. As everyone knows, NO ONE LIKES TO LOSE MONEY. So, why are all these gamblers investing in the democrats if they werenâ€™t favored to win? Because they ARE favored to win now. If those retarded gamblers are willing to gamble their money away on a Democratic senate win, then gambling your money on weed stocks is the perfect alternative to making fat stacks. As you can probably conclude, the betting is so low for a split ticket between a democrat and republican, itâ€™s expected to be almost impossible for both parties to be elected. There will only be one.

Not only this, but the majority of Georgians SUPPORT $2000 stimulus checks. This is especially bad for the Republican senators who rejected the vote on $2000 stimulus checks, but GREAT for the democratic runners. Georgians are expected to come out in waves to support the candidates that want the $2000 checks. This will lead to wider democratic support as the senate elections near and explain why the democrats are starting to get a lead. 

DEMOCRATS WILL WIN GEORGIA, AND TAKE THE SENATE, MARK MY WORDS!!

So why should you not lose all your money in GME and PLTR calls? Because this shit will make you more $$$ in one week than holding calls for months with those shitty ass short stocks. Thatâ€™s why I ended up YOLOING my entire balance on MSOS calls. MSOS is an ETF of American weed stocks, and is the perfect tendie gain for the upcoming news of a democratic victory. I was going to go with TLRY, but an ETF of American weed stocks looked like the better play both short and long term. 

Positions: $10k in MSOS ETF calls 40c 1/15/21 (ALL IN)

ALL IN BAYBEEE LETS BEAT MUSK TO MARS ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€


TL;DR: Weed stocks are going to fly in 2021. Democrats WILL win Georgia and take over the senate. Tons of fucking tendies in 2021 for all weed stocks, especially American.ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€"

Trading Reality Check,1609710012,Blackout1154,8,"This comes to you from TheStreet:

 

## 1. Predictions and Forecasts Are a Waste of Time

In the many years I've traded, I've heard an uncountable number of predictions and forecasts. The vast majority have been wrong or so poorly timed as to be useless. Wall Street loves predictions and forecasts because that is basically what they sell. They convince customers that they can predict the future better than you can and therefore you should pay them for their guesses about the future.

The market situation in 2020Â was one of the best examples ever of the futility of forecasting. No one anticipated what happened: a major pandemic, the worst economy in a century, a crazy political situation, and the stock market flying higher despite the news.

Predictions and forecasts are interesting and can help us prepare for volatility ahead, but it is the reaction to changing events that is the most important. Moving to the sidelines as a downtrend emerges will protect you better than any prediction or forecast. It is reacting decisively that works far better than predictions and forecasts.

Don't focus on anticipation and predictions. Focus on vigilance and reaction.

## 2. Compound Your Profits by Keeping Your Accounts as Close to Highs as Possible

Nothing is more counterproductive than making up losses. If you lose half of your money, you must double it to just return to even. If you are zealous at keeping your accounts near highs, you will outperform over the longer term.

Long-term buy-and-hold investing is often promoted because it allows you to compound your money and that it is what makes investors such as Warren Buffett so successful. However, you can also compound results when you keep your accounts at highs and continue to produce returns. It is not necessary to hold a single stock and hope that it is ""the one"" that will make you rich. You can engage in aggressive trading as you look for the best stocks and still benefit from the power of compounding by keeping your accounts near their highs.

Compounding fails to work when you suffer big drawdowns and losses. This happens to both long-term investors and short-term traders that fail to protect their gains. The key is to address it and not just sit there. If you err on the side of not suffering large losses, you will produce substantially better returns as you compound your capital.

&gt;*Charts are often dismissed as voodoo by the same people confident in their ability to predict macroeconomic events.*

## 3. Profits Occur Sporadically

The market is, and always will be, cyclical. It goes through ups and downs of various magnitudes on an irregular basis. Newer traders likely have a very unrealistic view of the bigger market picture. The style of trading that is working right now will not last forever and if you do not appreciate that fact, then your career in trading will be short-lived.

Traders should be mindful of the 80/20 rule. Most traders will typically produce 80% of their profits in 20% of the time. The other 80% of the time they make little progress. New traders that have immediate success will have a tough time dealing with this fact as the market shifts. Many have been spoiled recently by a fantastic market and they will give back much of their profits and eventually give up in defeat because they are not prepared for the inevitable shifts the market will undergo.

The problem with the 80/20 rule is that we never know when that period of peak productivity will occur. We must be constantly vigilant and ready to spring into action when favorable conditions occur. When they do occur, we have to ramp up our aggressiveness and profit while we can.

One trait effective traders share is the ability to be patient and do little for long periods, and then move suddenly and decisively when the time is right. Shifting from a patient state of mind to a more active one is not easy and becoming more cautious when conditions change is the key to holding onto gains.

## 4. Use Charts

Charts are often dismissed as voodoo by the same people who are confident of their ability to predict macroeconomic events, but they miss the main point. Charts are useful because they provide a framework for discipline. There are millions of ways to use charts, but at the heart of every method is cutting losses and letting profits run.

Don't think of charts as a way to predict the future. Think of charts as a way to manage your existing trades. The charts will help you when to buy and when to sell, but they won't tell you what is going to happen in the future. Charts are the best tool you have for developing the discipline you need to be a successful trader over the long haul.

## 5. No Trading Approach Is Inherently Superior

The best approach to the market is highly subjective. Some people do very well with trend-following and momentum. Others do equally well with value plays and fundamentals. What works best will depend on how you view the market and the methodology you use to protect capital and find new stocks to buy.

Work on developing a style that makes sense to you. If it doesn't work as well as you'd like, keep modifying it. The market is constantly changing, which means what works best will shift all the time. Just make sure you keep in mind the discussion about how profits tend to occur sporadically.

## 6. Trade Incrementally and in Multiple Time Frames

Most people think of the trading and investing process as being a single buy and then an eventual sale. They decide that this is a good stock, buy it, and then sit there and hope that it works out well. There is no strategy involved in this sort of market approach. You lose your power to control the situation when you trade in this manner.

The better approach is to move incrementally. Take an initial position and watch the action. Perhaps your opinion of the stock was wrong, or the market shifts. You can then quickly escape the situation with little loss. However, if the stock continues to develop well, then you can build the trade and become more aggressive.

As a good trade develops, you can focus on navigating it in a variety of time frames. Maybe keep a core position for weeks, months, or years while trading a portion as the inevitable ups and downs occur. Some of the best long-term buys also provide for great day trading. If you have a good stock pick, then why not trade it in multiples.

This strategic approach to trading and investing is key, and I spend a great amount of time expanding on this topic.

## 7. Trading Is Hard,Â Which Is Why It Can Make You Rich

If you read social media, it is easy to develop the impression that thousands of people make a huge amount of money with a steady diet of great stock picks.

The reality is that trading is tough and that even the best traders have substantial losses along the way. The very best traders are those that embrace the inevitable of poor trades and make them part of their process. No matter how good you are at trading, you will have losing streaks and be hit by tremendous bad luck at times. It is the nature of the beast.

However, it is because trading is so hard that it has the potential to reward you so greatly. It is trite to say, but it is true, ""nothing good comes easy."" It may feel easy at times, but long-term market success is a daily slog that requires hard work and will often be disappointing. Rather than be discouraged, take heart because if it was easy, you couldn't get rich doing it."

Why Index Funds are Not as Safe and Bubbles are Not as Destructive as You Might Believe,1609711738,negovany,262,"  According to Morningstar research in the middle of 2019 almost half of all US stocks were part of some passive index fund. This number almost doubled since 2009. In the meantime, active management is on a steady decline, especially active managed funds. Around the same time Dr. Michael Burry compared index funds to CDOs. Letâ€™s look into this case and try to draw something from it for our benefit.  

**1. How come index funds are compared to CDOs if they only track industries or sectors of economy?**

 What we often miss is that the index fund, instead of being a neutral observer, is an active participant in the fundamentals of the companies that compose a particular index. The fund does so by providing capital and influencing market value of a security (this also opens a window of opportunities for the company behind the ticker to raise capital via bank loans or private investments). Whatâ€™s so bad about this? Well, passive funds donâ€™t go through balance sheets, there is no fair value assessment, no analysis and no risk taking. They just buy whatever company is big enough to make it into the index. This company can then use provided capital to stay afloat or influence itâ€™s price by share buybacks, dividends or simply pay huge bonuses to itâ€™s management. Just like banks didnâ€™t care about subprime mortgages that were packed into CDOs, index funds managers donâ€™t care about what exactly goes into their â€˜soupâ€™. With the banks it was just greed and ignorance â€“ in case of index funds itâ€™s by design.  

When there is a stable influx of new capital into passive funds, zombie companies are dragged higher and higher. WSB goddess **Cathie Wood** called this the greatest misallocation of funds in the history. But why is so much cash flowing into index funds? Is it a trend? Is someone incentivized to promote them? Well, yes, but the main reason is different: boomer psychology and our friend, the FED. See, boomers have massive capitals. All those pension funds, retiring firefighters, trust babies, capital heirs â€“ they all seek safety. They donâ€™t try to get 500% returns YOY or lose it all. They are very content with just beating inflation. Throw few percents above inflation and they will be over the moon. For a long time their favorite asset class were treasuries.  

**2. What is happening to the bond market?**

 In 2016 US bond market was almost $40 trillion in value, compared to less than $20 trillion for the domestic stock market.  Now, I havenâ€™t seen yet the data about the size of US bond market of 2020, but everything points that itâ€™s ratio to stock market is deteriorating. The US 10-year government-bond yield fell from nearly 2.00% at the beginning of the year to an all-time low of just 0.31% in early March. Thatâ€™s what Rick Rule called â€˜return free riskâ€™, since allocating capital into these treasuries almost guarantees you to lose money to inflation. 

*Processing img q6r2fhqfu6961...*

Look at what is happening in Europe: â€œThe ECB, which added 500 billion euros ($606 billion) to its pandemic bond buying program, is set to own around 43% of Germanyâ€™s sovereign bond market by the end of next year and around two-fifths of Italian notes, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Thatâ€™s up from around 30% and 25% respectively at the end of 2019... Trading volumes in bund futures have collapsed 62% since the ECB started buying bonds, according to Axa, while ranges the lifeblood of traders have nosedived across Europe. In both the safest and riskiest nations, this quarterâ€™s spread between the highest and lowest yields is the tightest itâ€™s been since at least the global financial crisis.â€

The FED is doing quite the same. Buying bonds (including corporate) all over the place and lowering interest rates to the ground. Whatâ€™s even more devastating for boomers is that thereâ€™s no hope on the horizon: the Fed promises to keep interest rates low for the next few years. We are really heading towards Japan situation where the central bank is that fat ugly bully kid playing all by himself in the sandbox.

**3. Where to go if the bonds are not so hot?** 

 This all causes big money to chase the next best thing. What do people consider safe? Real Estate. And indeed it rose: according to Knight Frank Global House price index US housing prices rose 7% from Q3 2019 to Q3 2020. But thatâ€™s a lot of hustle for big money. And that is hardly a passive income, rather a career. So the next best thing is index funds. What can be better than tracking the whole US economy? Never bet against America, am I right? Even if we stumble upon a market crash sending S&amp;P down â€“ the economy will recover, it always does, right? The influx of cash into ETFs is basically a self fulfilling prophecy: it drives prices up and those yearly returns get even more lucrative compared to *sexy* 0.31% provided by treasuries.  

*Processing img db73yu15u6961...*

Even worse is that actively managed funds and bank investments start to, basically, replicate index funds. That is due to the risk/reward factor: if the funds outperform the market - they get some good rep and few new customers; but when they underperform the market â€“ they get absolutely obliterated. Only few outsiders can risk picking deep value stocks or plays, that are not common portfolio dwellers. Or it takes someone with huge authority like Warren Buffett or Howard Marks. 

**4. Bubbles everywhere**

 Now, at this point you might be on the edge of your seat, banging your fist and thinking that this is nothing but a bubble and the boomers, index funds and the Fed are to blame. Well, it is. Hard truth is that fundamentals in the long run always kick-in. So-called Buffett indicator (total stocks market cap to GDP) is almost at a record high. And on top of that we have Dot.com bubble 2.0 with crazy tech enthusiasm. And a second real estate bubble too. But I urge you to notice, that bubbles are not all the same with the same outcome. Well, they all go burst, but thatâ€™s not the point. There are bubbles that I would call â€˜General Market Heatâ€™ - situations when too much money goes into the market, causing it to overheat. Then some sort of event, panic, fear, or rumor, not necessary caused by declining fundamentals, sends the market to downward spiral. As an example: panic of 1857, 1929, 1987, etc. The better the fundamentals were and the least the government gets involved â€“ the faster it rebounds. Those bubbles do nothing but attract more speculators and their only result is the number of bankruptcies. Then there are bubbles that I would call â€˜Thematic Bubblesâ€™ - those are dedicated to some specific industry or a number of particular stocks that are expected to grow enormously. Tulip Mania in Netherlands (1637), Railway Mania in UK (1840s), Video Games Crash of 1983, Dot Com Bubble (2000). They all chased some particular novelty and all landed on their faces. But doing so they provided huge capital to developing industries. Dot Com Bubble gave us rapid growth of internet usage. Video Games chase of the late 70s and early 80s gave us the golden age of arcade gaming and huge inventions in graphics and game tech. Railway Mania left Britain with the largest system of railroads in the world. And guess who is the biggest exporter of tulips and holds 49 % of the global flower market? Yep, Netherlands, to this day, almost 400 years since the mania!  

This did not in any way benefit the majority of investors who went down with the bubble. But you can view this as a sacrifice of dumb and greedy people for the benefit of the progress. I get a sense of pride in this noble cause, as a member of WSB community.  

Back to boomers and index funds. By pouring money into index funds they provide capital both to disruptive industries and to zombie companies. The good thing is that the tech gets the majority of it, since it has the biggest share. Just look at the SPY top 6 holdings:  

*Processing img ien160wku6961...*

Itâ€™s genuinely good that companies like Tesla will get allocation of billions and billions which they (frankly) do not quite deserve at current fundamentals. This will accelerate their growth. The bad thing is that such allocations cement big tech monopolies, damaging competition. And it also provides liquidity to zombie companies big enough to make it into indexes.  

Difference is that innovative companies use this cash to reinvest into future growth. Thatâ€™s exactly why their P/E ratios are so bad. Zombies spend cash on buybacks and management bonuses. Because of how all these companies are tied together in index funds and due to the nature of modern margin calls â€“ once any segment of the stock market falls, there will be a massive dip. Tech can drown any industry stocks with them and vice versa. But the Tech will be able to cut investments, R&amp;D and expansions and become profitable, while zombies with a big debt will go bankrupt. Either way itâ€™s investors, who will bear the pain.  

**5. What shall we draw from here:**

1) There are huge inflows into the stock market. And the blame is not so much on the kids with RH as it is on the boomers and â€˜smart moneyâ€™ chasing index funds;  

2) If you want to short any of the bubbles as a hedge â€“ do not short the most growing and volatile sectors and ETFs like QQQ, because they benefit from the current market in a long run. And also the premiums are huge due to IV. Rather short slow and steady industries, because they will get nuked just as much in case of a crash, but the premiums you pay now will be much lower;

3) Passive index funds investing makes â€˜price discoveryâ€™ and a search for deep value so much more challenging. But not impossible. Basically, Peter Lynchâ€™s advise to look for companies with smaller institutional ownership still lives up today.

Does this mean that prices canâ€™t be good or go up under big index allocation? Hell no. But the chance to find a ten-bagger declines.  

As an anecdote: look into our championâ€™s GME institutional ownership: on Jan 31 2020 it was 96.6 % and declined to relatively low 66.7 by Sep 30. Exactly before it doubled in the next 3 months;

4) Some bubbles provide needed capital to developing and hyped industries causing structural change. Unfortunately, it is paid by investors who rarely see any return;

5) FED is to blame for everything (as always);

6) WSBers will lose money either way (as always).

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

**The bond market is similar to boomers wives: sexy in the 80s, not so much today. Constant intrusions by their relatives (the FED) into their relationships makes things even worse. That sends boomers chasing young girls - the stocks. But their dongles arenâ€™t so active anymore, so boomers prefer passive approach, using a dating app - index funds. Unfortunately, there are only so many hot girls among young ladies on the app. This leads to ugly ones receiving attention and money from boomers, which they otherwise wouldnâ€™t deserve. Some of those ladies spend money wisely and will be good to go once the boomer dies out. Others immediately waste it on shopping. Now, if a young man wants to find a truly beautiful lady with reasonable expectations â€“ he has a better chance searching outside of the boomer dating app.**

MOVIE THEATERS ON MARS?! (DD) ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€,1609712319,jcaliente12,63,"What up you gay nerds. Here's 4 reasons why movie theaters will NOT go bankrupt and why they will rebound by March 2021. (DD)

1) Stock offerings. These are bound to happen. Movie theaters have been among the companies hit the hardest during this global pandemic and raising money through stock offerings are not unique to movie theaters. However, I can tell you, as a veteran of the stock market, stock offerings of this volume are NOT an action taken by companies about to go bankrupt. It is merely to stay afloat. They know that positive news is coming, and those who benefit are those who don't bearishly think bankruptcy is an option for a powerhouse movie theater brands. Don't shell out your hard-earned $5 on RH gold to read bullshit from bear-cuck analysts like Morningstar and buy shares instead. Thank me later.  
 

2) Adaptation. We are adapting to this pandemic. We now understand COVID-19 to be a droplet-transmissible disease that can be prevented by wearing a mask and taking basic precautions like washing your hands before eating/touching your mucous membranes. As a hospital administrator, I work with both friends and family who work intimately with COVID positive patients for HOURS in the ICU and ED and none of them have contracted it... why? Because PPE WORKS! (goddamnit anti-maskers). When Biden steps into office, you will immediately see a rise in movie theater stocks, as they are often the first to rebound because we all understand it's upward potential. In the next month, as the highest at risk (elderly/those with predisposed symptoms) receive their second dose of vaccinations, we will see a declining number of severe cases, leading to a sharp decrease in ICU hospitalizations. This news will be good for movie theaters. As the general public receives the vaccine, we will see public confidence returning and many will return to the theaters (with masks of course).  
 

3) Demand. We've all been stuck inside for almost a year, watching the same Netflix shows as our parents. Fun fact: Movie theaters BOOMED in the 30s post-Spanish flu, because humans have an inherent need to watch flicks on the big screen. Think of all you retard autists and how you're going to try and spit game after a year of staying in. Fuck that. Take your date to the theaters and talk about something relatable besides that you gained 20 pounds ordering from Uber Eats every day for the past year.  
 

4) AM\*+ (Yes, A\*C+ is the rebrand of \_\_\_ premier, the streaming service for \*MC and it is a critical reason for why they will stay in business and thrive.) The Walking Dead Season 10 is out by the way (surprisingly good, considering they killed off most of the OG cast). Subscription goes for $8.99 a month and counts estimate over 1 million new subscribers in 2020. Do the math and expect this to bolster stock price at the next earning report.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Those who buy in now to movie theater stocks should see 100-200% gains by Spring 2021. Quote me on it. Ban me if it doesn't happen."

NIO $50 Call 01/15 bought at 2x its current value. Thoughts?,1609713048,archer_it,66,"Hello fellow retards,

In mid-November, I made a very stupid purchase and bought $50c with Jan 15 exp at $8.35. 

My call went down as much as 64% as of Dec 28, but I held. In the past week, itâ€™s gained close to 30%. Overall, the call is now worth $4.15, ~50% below my purchase price.

Given the recent great news regarding December and 4Q20 deliveries as well as NIO day on Jan 9, what do you think I should do with my call? 
- Hold until then to limit my losses given the uptrend? or 
- Do you think itâ€™s worth roll it over to March-May call?

Thanks retards!

Best,

PLTR Valuation Lies,1609715462,IHateMonie,88,"Don't listen to the analyst's lies or the articles about valuation. The concept of valuation is being used as a weapon against you and right now the only reason PLTR ðŸš€ stock is dropping is because of:

1) Heavy short interest with 70M (as of early December) shares sold short out of \~500m float.

2) Tards losing money on the massive amount of weekly call buying. 

&amp;#x200B;

PLTRðŸš€ is a good company and the institutions know it. Back in 2018 Morgan Stanley was saying that their IPO in 2020 should be 36-41B ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-18/palantir-weighs-ipo-valued-at-as-much-as-41-billion-wsj-says](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-18/palantir-weighs-ipo-valued-at-as-much-as-41-billion-wsj-says)). This price was based off of projections using growth numbers from back in 2018. We know that growth has picked up a bit. As of last Thursday PLTR ðŸš€ is currently valued at 41B but the last PT and ""downgrade"" Morgan Stanley gave was  a $17 or a 30B market cap. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Back in 2018 Morgan Stanley said PLTRðŸš€ was worth \~$23.60 (41B market cap) a share and now they are saying it is worth $17 (30B market cap) a share. They are trying to steal tendies from you."

This will be the year millionaires are made from Tesla Puts,1609718659,tdogger88,569,"Tesla stock went up almost 700% this year because Wedbush (whoâ€™s made an absolute fortune getting people to buy into his narrative) got retail investors to buy into the narrative that Tesla is not an automotive company, despite over 90% of its revenue coming from selling cars. Once the narrative stuck that itâ€™s a â€œtechâ€ company, BAM, valuation goes up $550B. And please donâ€™t be an autist and say something retarded like â€œif Tesla is a car company then Apple is a phone companyâ€. Yes, over 50% of apples revenue is from phones, but they also have huge revenue segments in Mac, IPad, Audio, Services, etc. So, if Apples revenue was 90% phones then yes that statement would be true, buts itâ€™s not so please donâ€™t try and justify it with that stupid brainwashing comment (which I know someone will post in the comments and get 1k upvotes). 

Now, Tesla is a phenomenal company with a visionary leader, donâ€™t get me wrong - but they are being priced like the next Amazon. One slip up and they will tumble - or if they canâ€™t find that one thing that will essentially print money for them (Apple iPhone, Google ads, Microsoft Azure, Amazon web services), then valuation will get cut in half. The first 6x months will be about value stocks, and I predict Tesla hits $500 before it hits $900. I think this year makes millionaires first from Tesla puts, then calls in the second half of the year. 

The only thing I can think of that makes this not happen is the amount of cash they have on hand from selling more shares. That amount of money is dangerous in the hands of Elon. But letâ€™s see what happens - I think puts are the way to go early on, could net some new millionaires."

Palantir is long term play and takes mainstream finance media news/rating after your own DD only,1609724372,Sachinvats,107,"The whole street made bearish sentiment about the Palantir direct listing and the best target price was given is at 13$ for a year out. What do you think they will do if the stock triples in less than a month. They can't go and say that we are updating their 1-2-month-old recommendations to reflect that. They are OK doing it for 30-40% but not for 300%. They have no option but to issue a sell rating and bearish sentiment about it. At a given time there are always bearish and bull sentiments and with enough confirmation bias, you can write whatever. We have seen this in the case of Tesla for e.g. JP Moron has a price target of 80-90$ for tesla and on another hand, they have a buy rating for Nikola. While JPM was telling street to sell Tesla, they loaded themselves in Q3-Q4 in tesla. They offer unique leveraged products to customers based on ARK etfs, which has maxed its Tesla capacity. Long story short, these people are in business to prove them right instead of giving opinions to the general public. There is hardly anyone in the analyst community who understands AI, ML, Big data beyond tech buzz words (Ark is an exception). I spent 15 yrs in the industry and spent the whole of my career building ANN/PCA/SOM models for large 4D simulation problem for projects required multi-billion$ investments and then executing these projects. Today I work in Strategy consulting and with few things i learned over the years, my POV is Palantir is misrepresented by mainstream finance and instead we should focus on more what Karp is saying, how the quarterly number looks, which industry they are entering and who is the real competition

One portion of Palantir is little understood is its 2016 acquisition of Silk Kimono, it has to yield results in the coming days

We listen that Palantir has lost money for a long time. it is important to understand that investing back is not money lost and if we see investments and growth in revenue - it's somewhat a proxy for it

Amazon has done it for 2 decades

Once you stop doing that you become a tech value company under the clock of innovation growth company (which you are no longer)

I can't say in the short term what is the right price, In the long term, i see Palantir at a 10x-20x valuation of its value from direct listing

With my own limited understanding of business and things that I learned (certified nerd, with serious degrees from very serious colleges), I ran an exercise that how to identify companies that have 1 Trillion$ potential by 2030 and under 50 billion$ now - Palantir and SpaceX were two filtered out

so I am long Palantir, SpaceX and off course long Tesla also.

The stock has got volatile as initially, it had a bad press, and then there was no IPO or SPAC euphoria. Once it gained, it became a meme stock. The stock is new in public markets and unique growth stock

So people are still trying to figure it out. What it does, it does best. Customer acquisition is not easy but as they prove their worth, it should get better.

See the case of BP, they pay Palantir 120 million $ a year No oil company pays this much to any of the company for digital and software serviceâ€™s And Bp has stated value of Palantir very openly.

They only have one client in all the industries they work In private space. There is a huge opportunity. They have started with a top-down solution model, But they will@make more and more solutions

Possibly new business models, As well.

This company has just started building a sales and marketing team and One thing a good sales team does is to sell proven solutions, again and again, We need 1-2 yrs to see that impact

I assume customer acquisition for Palantir is a 1-1.5 yr process. Thiel has said several times that his focus is to help navigate companies through key inflection points

No other company symbolizes him more than Palantir today. So I donâ€™t see him bailing out. Alex Karp is super passionate.

Unfortunately I don't see nasdaq 100 micro options to have a decent market, at least not right now, hopefully it will change during the regular trading hours. Micro SP500 options show a bit wider quotes compared to the mini contract options, but I did get a fill paying a quarter above what the ""fair"" price (based on the market in the same strike in e-mini options).

Why a Democratic Sweep could Spell BIG BIG Trouble for Tech,1609736872,ptrader99,0,"As of late, Democrats have taken the lead in the Georgia Senate run-offs, which could spell big trouble for tech companies sporting lofty valuations, especially non-profitable ones.

So why exactly does a Blue Wave spell trouble for tech companies?

A couple reasons: more fiscal spending, higher inflation expectations, higher interest rates, less valuable long-term cashflows, tech trade crowding, and hedge fund leverage. Let me explain.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fiscal Spending, Inflation, and Interest Rates**

Generally speaking, Democratic policy favors a large government budget, and with hopes to spend over [$5T](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/14/politics/biden-tax-spending-plans-trump-deficits/index.html) on clean energy/infrastructure, education, and healthcare Biden's team isn't breaking from the mold. A blue wave would make it much easier for the Biden administration to enact these policies. While Biden is planning on increasing taxes by $3.4T to offset his spending, the government still needs to create money to finance these projects, which [leads to inflation](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/pam/pam49/pam4901.htm). Moreover, the Fed has taken a newly lax stance on its price stability mandate, and is [welcoming](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/economy_14400.htm) inflation of more than 2%, so it won't hesitate to let prices run hot to achieve its inflation target. As shown in the graph below, 10 yr bond yields (and fed funds rate) tend to be highly correlated to measures of inflation, as its a natural way to dampen the acceleration of rising prices. 

*Processing img oi2avfmij8961...*

Summary: dem sweep = higher fiscal spending = higher inflation = higher interest rates

**How This Affects Tech Stock Valuation**

For all the retards who have never taken a finance course or don't understand basic valuation techniques, the essence of stock valuation is projecting future free cash flows and discounting them back at a risk adjusted rate (b/c $1 is worth more today than $1 five yrs from now, and there's not 100% certainty in the CFs the company might produce in the future). Thus, the main determinant of a company's value is its profitability, the rate at which you discount the company's cash flows, and the time horizon you analyze it at (which can be related to the discount rate). For those actually interested, you can read more [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp). With the current fed funds rate pinned between 0% and .25% and the 10yr yield less than 1%, you can practically look out at a time horizon of 10-20 years before discounting back cash flows. Though still a stretch, interest rates at this level might be able to justify some of the 30-50x price/sales multiples we see in certain growthy tech names at the moment. 

*Processing img hkp0azshn8961...*

That said, if interest rates do begin to rise as a result of a blue sweep, and analysts are forced to incorporate risk free rates of 2-3+% into their discount rates at time horizons where these companies generate little profit, tech companies could see their valuation multiples deteriorate by 50+%. Even just pre-Covid valuation multiples for the above growthy names would absolutely crush their stock price. I understand Covid brought forward significant demand for tech companies and in many ways permanently altered consumer behavior, but this chart shows pure multiple expansion on the basis of forward revenues (not even earnings!), assuming low discount rates and near-infinite time horizons. 

**Crowded Long Tech Trade**

It's no real surprise, but according to a recent BofA survey, the long technology strategy is the most popular/crowded among fund managers. Also, a year-end Morgan Stanley report indicated that hedge fund gross and net exposure was near all-time highs at 100% and 96%ile, respectively.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img aluszbntp8961...*

**A Quick Note on Leverage**

Hedge funds use leverage to amplify returns, and when leverage is cheap (see above), they are more keen to do so. If a hedge fund is levered at 2x, it has $100 of capital to support $200 of positions. A 10% drawdown would leave the fund with $80 of capital to support $180 of positions, with a new leverage multiple of 2.25x. If this were to happen, the fund would have to sell roughly 20% of its book to maintain its leverage ratio. In such a crowded trade, selling like this would cause another fund to liquidate a portion of its holdings to not become over levered, and this self-sustaining cycle of selling persists. An example of this price action and positive feedback loop is the ""[Quant Quake](https://extractalpha.com/2017/08/11/the-quant-quake-10-years-on)"" of 2007 though its trade was less crowded and firms were probably more highly levered.

**Conclusion/TLDR**

A blue wave and higher interest rates (or even the fear/expectation thereof) could quickly unravel the long technology trade due to its crowding, leverage, and a newfound preference for shorter duration cash flows, crushing the stock prices of non-profitable tech companies.

For those actually interested, you can read moreÂ [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp). With the current fed funds rate pinned between 0% and .25% and the 10yr yield less than 1%, you can practically look out at a time horizon of 10-20 years before discounting back cash flows. Though still a stretch, interest rates at this level might be able to justify some of the 30-50x price/sales multiples we see in certain growthy tech names at the moment.Â 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img zz9kh4q019961...*

That said, if interest rates do begin to rise as a result of a blue sweep, and analysts are forced to incorporate risk free rates of 2-3+% into their discount rates at time horizons where these companies generate little profit, tech companies could see their valuation multiples deteriorate by 50+%. Even just pre-Covid valuation multiples for the above growthy names would absolutely crush their stock price. I understand Covid brought forward significant demand for tech companies and in many ways permanently altered consumer behavior, but this chart shows pure multiple expansion on the basis of forward revenues (not even earnings!), assuming low discount rates and near-infinite time horizons.Â 

**Crowded Long Tech Trade**

It's no real surprise, but according to a recent BofA survey, the long technology strategy is the most popular/crowded among fund managers. Also, a year-end Morgan Stanley report indicated that hedge fund gross and net exposure was near all-time highs at 100% and 96%ile, respectively.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img zjm238h219961...*

**A Quick Note on Leverage**

Hedge funds use leverage to amplify returns, and when leverage is cheap (see above), they are more keen to do so. If a hedge fund is levered at 2x, it has $100 of capital to support $200 of positions. A 10% drawdown would leave the fund with $80 of capital to support $180 of positions, with a new leverage multiple of 2.25x. If this were to happen, the fund would have to sell roughly 20% of its book to maintain its leverage ratio. In such a crowded trade, selling like this would cause another fund to liquidate a portion of its holdings to not become over levered, and this self-sustaining cycle of selling persists. An example of this price action and positive feedback loop is the ""[Quant Quake](https://extractalpha.com/2017/08/11/the-quant-quake-10-years-on)"" of 2007 though its trade was less crowded and firms were probably more highly levered.

**Conclusion/TLDR**

A blue wave and higher interest rates (or even the fear/expectation thereof) could quickly unravel the long technology trade due to its crowding, leverage, and a newfound preference for shorter duration cash flows, crushing the stock prices of non-profitable tech companies.

If I invest in Pershing Square Tontine Holdings will I actually own a whole stock come merger time?,1609737847,nyulspboy,6,"Im wondering if I invest and grab like 3 or 4 shares of Pershing Square Tontine Holdings will I actually own those whole shares in the actualized company once it merges and brings a specific company public. So lets say I Invest now and they end up merging with a company like SpaceX. Will I now own those 3 shares in SpaceX?

Im asking because Ive been seeing some news saying that I would actually own ""sponsored warrants"" and other items that mention that I would have the ability to receive a share for 2/9ths of the price and I have no idea what any of those terms mean.

 **ðŸš€** 

In this video, he goes onto answer a series of questions in regards to why he ALL INED on Apple and Wells Fargo after he sold Chewy for 3.3 billion dollars (making it the largest eCommerce deal in history).

 **ðŸš€** 

Alright now you fucks, think about what I just said for a second. 

 **ðŸš€** 

Ryan Cohen. ALL INED. on APPLE. AFTER SELLING HIS BUSINESS FOR 3 BILLION DOLLARS.

 **ðŸš€** 

Are you fucking retarded? Let me explain, fuck.

 **ðŸš€** 

If you recall, in August of this year, Tesla stock split. You know what other stock split? APPLE.

 **ðŸš€** 

When the split occurred, Apple shareholders received four shares for everyone they held prior.

 **ðŸš€** 

That means that when Cohen ALLED IN ON APPLE WITH A SHIT TON OF MONEY he then received FOUR TIMES THE NUMBER OF SHARES.

 **ðŸš€** 

HE HAS SO MUCH FUCKING MONEY TO DO EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS TO DO WITH GAMESTOP. 

 **ðŸš€**

This shitty pennystock **TransEnterix** seems to be a legit buy for the upcoming weeks. At least some Nigerian prince told me in an E-Mail. 

It's up 20% in the pre-market. Haven't had the balls go balls deep in this though. Is this just a meme stock? Or if it is, does that even matter?

(Sorry for posting wallstreet-non related stuff here)

So basically im gonna be a college freshman next yr
And ive recently got accepted into wisconsin school of business and pennstate smeal college, both are finance major. 

Although Pennstate smeal has a lower ranking, it is closer to new york, compared to higher rank uw madison which is in midwest.

I first thought that higher rank means easier to get an investment analyst job at NY...however someone told me that since pennstate is closer to NY, the connection is bigger (so easier to find a high income job there)

So in ur opinion (with a little bit explanation would be much appreciated!) which school actually is going to let me have a higher chance to get an analyst job at NY?


(Again i know i shouldnt ask here but because im intl, it is $$$, so i wanna make sure i make the best decision and not waste my parents savings)

Thankssss"

Palantir $22.5M contract with Japan,1609761685,infinity884422,170,"DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) announced today that on December 28, 2020, it was awarded a $22.5 million, one-year contract in partnership with SOMPO Holdings for the â€œReal Data Platform for Security, Health, and Wellbeingâ€. SOMPOâ€™s visionary Real Data Platform, or â€œRDPâ€ is a collaborative ecosystem between public and private sectors that will improve healthcare in Japan, streamline supply chains across industries, and increase security and resilience in the region.

In November 2019, SOMPO and Palantir jointly established Palantir Technologies Japan K.K., a technology company that would provide Palantirâ€™s platforms and services in Japan. Already, Palantir Japan has actively supported elder care transformation, with active work across dozens of facilities to make care plans more efficient and effective and improve facility operations.

SOMPOâ€™s RDP objectives will accelerate the digital transformation of Japanese commercial and governmental institutions, and create connected infrastructure across key industries. Japanese industries, ranging from healthcare to automotive to manufacturing, have generated a tremendous amount of â€œreal dataâ€ over the past few decades. For example, Japan alone has more than 60,000 elder care facilities, each generating real data from suppliers, facilities, care plans, training programs, and more. The RDP, with SOMPO at the forefront, will serve as the connected infrastructure for this and other industries, including logistics, transportation, research, and government agencies.

Further updates on the RDP will be provided in a forthcoming joint press release between SOMPO and Palantir."

"Stock Market News for Today | TSLA, NIO, LMND, FUBO, ROKU &amp; Other Stock Market News [01-04]",1609765891,0toHeroInvesting,27,"**Stocks end 2020 on the high note with Tesla closing over 700$. Is Lemonade overvalued? FuboTv keeps on crumbling while NIO posts great sales numbers, letâ€™s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, letâ€™s start with the recap of the last trading day of 2020, as we saw both the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/bHgX2sf) and the [Dow Jones Industrial](https://ibb.co/D471c7X) finish up over 0.60% and finishing at record highs, while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/vzGgSBb)  finished barely up for the day, gaining .14%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/2YrvMpT) finishing just down for the day, but itâ€™s still up from a [week](https://ibb.co/LxdGJ8c) ago, as the volatility still remains way above the [levels](https://ibb.co/XbWkzW4) before March when it rose to over 80.

We just about saw a positive ratio of companies [advancing](https://ibb.co/5TwrM2m) to close out the year as the volume was belove average with just 100 new highs, as we saw 10 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/yyrTGGP) finishing in the green with Utilities, Financials, Real Estate &amp; Health Care gaining more than 1% while Energy was the only sector to finish the day with a loss.  
We also saw most factor groups [finishing](https://ibb.co/dmvNJgL) the day in the red with only Large-Cap Value companies posting a gain of .3%, as you can see in Thursdayâ€™s [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/wBGr7cR) with gains all around the board, while losses were concentrated in the Biotech and Oil &amp; Gas industry.

Here is the weekly [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/zQWD12B) with names like Alibaba, Shopify, Palantir, Square and Zoom being some of the biggest losers, while TESLA continued to push higher as Tesla finished the month of [December](https://ibb.co/ZX09X8Z) with a gain of more than 20% as you can see here, while many of the other big tech names also had a strong month, with most of the losses being concentrated in the communication sector and of course Alibaba which was hit by a lot of negative news.

We also [finished](https://ibb.co/r5JRk5b) the year with most sectors in the green as you can see here, led by Technology, Consumer Cyclicals and Communications. But gains were had in most other sectors as well, except the Financial, Travel and Energy sectors, which finished the year down.

The biggest [losers](https://ibb.co/nDgRs1S) in the SP500 which finished the year up more than 16% were by far stocks like Carnival, OXY, Norwegian Cruise Line, United Airlines and many more others. The Nasdaq 100 wasnâ€™t safe either despite jumping almost 50% in 2020, having the best gains in 11years, with companies like Walgreens, Fox and Intel posting losses of over 17%, while the Dow was the laggard finishing just over 7% up for the year as Boeing, Chevron and Intel dragged the index lower.

We also saw huge [winners](https://ibb.co/n7yP7cM)  in 2020, as the SP500 was led higher by stocks like Apple, Nvidia, PayPal, Amazon and many others that posted huge gains. While the Nasdaq 100 jumped to record highs lead by Tesla which posted an incredible year with other stocks like Moderna, Peloton &amp; Zoom also rising by more than 300%. The Dow also had big winners but still lagged as the biggest gainers here were the tech giants Apple &amp; Microsoft joined by some other stocks like Nike, Disney &amp; Salesforce.

We also got some economic data since Thursday as Macauâ€™s gaming [revenue](https://ibb.co/NWBrC3s) continued the slow recovery, but the visits in the travel dependent region were 20% higher in the Holiday period compared to the start of December, which may be another positive sign for the Macau Gambling business.

Meanwhile we also received the latest jobless [numbers](https://ibb.co/Km8px8X), which dipped below 800K again, 19K less than last week and more than 40K less than expected, as the continuing jobless claims also fell to just over 5.2M more than 100K better than expected and the previous [report](https://ibb.co/gJLQYPB).

While this [week](https://ibb.co/mDnXFZY) we start to receive important economic data that alongside the results of the Georgia runoff election might push the market either to more gains, or if the results and data donâ€™t show up as investors &amp; analysts expected it, we might see an increase in volatility again which will lead to a market pullback or correction, which in my opinion would be a good time to go out and find deals to buy again.

We also really donâ€™t get any significant [earnings](https://ibb.co/60QM77h) releases this week, with most of the interesting ones like Micron, Walgreens &amp; Bed Bath &amp; Beyond coming on Thursday.

So, in some other stock market news, Tesla topped [expectations](https://ibb.co/g9048Ry) of 163K deliveries in Q4 again but did finish just shy of the 500K mark. The company delivered more than 180K vehicle in the last quarter, as we saw [Tesla](https://ibb.co/th7Hhnc)  pricing the model Y at just over $50.000 in China and are expecting to start deliveries this month as they keep expanding their sales in the worldâ€™s biggest car market, as they are targeting to make this their biggest market surpassing the US. Tesla closed over 700$ for the first time and if you want to see my opinion on this stock, check out my prediction on Tesla [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kci2lk/my_tesla_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/).

Some other EV makers from China also posted sales numbers with [Li Auto](https://ibb.co/LYCSs1N) increasing deliveries five-fold year/year with a 32% increase month/month in December, while [XPENG](https://ibb.co/Zc7FSQC) also announced record delivery numbers up 35% month/month and more than 300% year/year for December. We also saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/4VWGX78) posting a monthly deliveries record of just over 7K, up over 120% year/year and finishing the year with over 43K deliveries, which were also up over 110% year/year, as they are also planning on revealing some new sedan models and their latest developments on self-driving and other technologies next week.

Meanwhile we saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/dKh6kx0) take a ride after another short-seller released a statement, pointing out to the final lock-up period after the IPO, as a moment that will bring huge selling to this stock, despite the [company](https://ibb.co/YWksq6g) needing just over 4 years to reach the first million customers, less than 5 times the time it took companies like StateFarm, Geico and Allstate to reach their first million. I personally am an investor in this company, and I really like what they are doing, so I am not going to sell my shares anytime soon.

Guys, personally I canâ€™t wait to see the sales numbers and how the services business is growing for [Apple](https://ibb.co/cx07jJs) as the top-of-the-line products keep having great demand, but we do have to see what happens in the US-China relations, as this could impact the Apple revenue stream, this after the New York Stock Exchange has [started](https://ibb.co/599nrxc) the process of delisting telecom giants from China. You can check out my prediction on Apple [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kmzvqv/apple_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell_aapl/)

We also saw a [memo](https://ibb.co/qyBfzrq) from DELTAâ€™s CEO, as he expects the company to return to positive cashflow in the spring, as they are planning to start paying down debt as soon as that happens to reduce the burden the company has taken on since March 2020.

Meanwhile [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/Dg5jZ6x) continues its sharp decline after a number of firms have started to short the stock pointing to insane valuations and outlook. Fubo plunged again almost 16% Thursday and is down almost 50% in the past week as the IPO lockup period expired, more than tripling the shares float.

And on last piece of news that just came out is that [Roku](https://ibb.co/gM8Z4Bv) is looking to buy the content catalog from Quibi, this would give a boost to Rokuâ€™s exclusive programming, as the stock has seen an immediate reaction and is up over 3.5% in pre-market trading.

Letâ€™s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/zf9tMYZ) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the SP500 leading the way to start off the year as we wait to receive the first economic [data](https://ibb.co/f24tRCS) this year in the early morning, while the global stock [markets](https://ibb.co/sjvZMrx) started on a positive note except Japan.

Tendies ahead!,1609769458,domotorbeni,25,"A catalyst and a promising chart, that's all we need to go to *Tendie Town!* We have both, with APHA and TLRY. That's right boys, I am going to talk about POT stocks, so if you are bearish on the industry please stop reading. In case you don't know, they are going to merge under the ticker; TLRY. 

Both of the companies are Canadian and they will create the biggest cannabis company.  The new CEO will be the current Chief Executive of APHRIA. After the merger, they will move their HQ to the USA to bolster its presence in the u.s market, which is projected to be a 39-46 Billion market by 2024 compared to the 4.75 Billion Canadian markets.

I think it's a turning point for Tilray. Why? Well, their cost of production is very high (5.38 USD/gram), and margins are very poor at the same time. That is why they have to dilute shareholder's value. While APHRIA's cost of production is much lower (1.41 USD/gram). So TILRAY will capitalize at an instant if they can move their production to APHRIA. But how does APHA benefit from this deal?! They will get Tilray's demand revenue and distribution network.

Of course, there are some involved as well. If the merger will no happen, TLRY will fall as quickly as a one-legged fat man. Secondly, TLRY still has a lot of debt, and it will not disappear as your wife did. Lastly, cannabis is still illegal on the federal level, it will take some time until it will be legalized (if it will)...

Let's head to the charts and draw some magic crayons to see whether it is a good entry point or not because the wrong timing can f&amp;@k up everything. 

I can assure you, that we have here the most predictable chart like ever. If you take a look at the 4-hour chart, you will recognize that we had a massive breakout on 16th Dec. Since we are making lower highs and lows. The general picture remained bullish. I see 3 possible scenarios ahead:

\&gt;1:(bullish): we are not going back below 8.11, and test the 8.71 resistance (high volume needed). This will be a good implication for a trend reversal/ bottom.

\&gt;2:(less bullish): we will bounce back from the 7.61 level and test the upper resistance. Strong momentum and high volume are crucial.

\&gt;3:(bearish): No bounce back will occur, in this case, we will tank until some positive news is coming out.

IV is very low. So we can profit only from IV rise as well.

Been following this sub for just a few short weeks and I must say I'm impressed. You degenerates regularly give me a good laugh, though every now and again I do strike gold and learn something here. However, given my job, I can't trade options at all and I can't sell short. Basically, the only things I'm allowed to do are buy and hold equities. An additional restriction is that when I buy an equity, if I'm in the green, I must hold it for a minimum of 60 days prior to exiting (though I can sell for a loss at any time). So with that, I want to share one of my picks in 2020 that I likely won't be exiting any time soon, and that's Curaleaf - CURLF.

Yeah, yeah yeah, I know what you're thinking- this guy must be high. But I digress.

I believe that Curaleaf is in the best position, nationally, to take advantage of the continued shift towards Marijuana policy at the state level and even more importantly, the national level (SAFE Banking Act and/orMORE Act - if Congress doesn't completely shit itself). Right now they are operating in 23 states, with 96 dispensaries, 26 cultivation or grow sites, and have over 30 processing sites.  I see public opinion continue to shift in favor of Marijuana and I see a shitload of states crying out poor us, with fucked budgets - well, what better way to make some money than to legalize Marijuana at some level and then tax the shit out of it? Look at Colorado. They did so well with Marijuana that they said fuck it, let's get everyone on the Mushroom trip.

For anyone that hasn't heard of them, Curaleaf is the largest vertically integrated Marijuana company in the United States (by measure of revenue after their acquisition of GrassRoots in July 2020). For my fellow uneducated types, vertically integrated means that they own the entire process from seed to sale - the cultivation or growing sites, to the processing sites, to the actual dispensaries where the product is sold - and they are headquartered in Wakefield, Mass - not in some obscure place in Canada. What even is Canada, but America's hat? Socialists. The legal Marijuana business across the US generated about 13.6 billion in 2019 and MorningStar Financial believes that it will continue to grow by a 25% average per year in the recreational market and 15% within the medical market. 

Their growth has been nothing short of astounding - primarily driven via acquisitions. Each quarter they are successfully building on their strategy of launching / opening additional retail locations in key untapped markets, expanding in their current markets, all while pushing their own Select brand, with higher margins. Here's a good article from their billionaire backer on Forbes on where he sees the company going in the longer term, quote to be the ""FritoLay of Cannabis"". 

 [https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2020/11/27/inside-curaleaf-billionaire-boris-jordans-hunger-to-become-the-frito-lay-of-cannabis/?sh=6e7c8be72196](https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2020/11/27/inside-curaleaf-billionaire-boris-jordans-hunger-to-become-the-frito-lay-of-cannabis/?sh=6e7c8be72196)

Another 12% is owned by founders fund which is Thielâ€™s VC and it looks like it was a cross fund investment. The earlier funds will likely need to liquidate. 20% is owned by sompo a strategic Japanese insurance company which is creating a JV in Japan. Out of the cap table about 20% is held by VCs which need to liquidate due to fund life terms. The 60% that is owned by Thiel, Karl and Sompo is not going to be sold. Employee option is peanuts. 20% is the float that is traded already. That leaves about 10% by the VCs. Itâ€™s closer to 250 million shares or about 4 days trading volume, which is no big deal.

On their F-4 form filled 31 december they announce that AMAZON is the mysterious 2500 purchase order buyer. 

Now you might think, sure it already pumped and its a sell the news event. Well you are wrong because they have had no coverage of this on the media yet. Once your friend Cramer or Yahoo finance decides to spill the beans the rocket will start launching. 

I've been following NGA since they announced and made a DD already on it if you wanna take a look. 

I still think many more news are coming out soon with orders (Republic services being potentially one of them)

Will we see a selloff if Dems take Georgia?,1609776474,DonUnagi,0,"Saw this on Yahoo Finance:

Oppenheimer sees 6-10% drop in S&amp;P 500 â€˜should Democrats win both seatsâ€™ in Georgia runoff elections

The Georgia Senate runoff elections pose a near-term risk to equities, and an outcome in which both Democratic challengers emerge victorious could spark a notable drop in the stock market, according to Oppenheimer strategist John Stoltzfus.

â€œA Democratic sweep of the two run-off elections in Georgia could cause the US equity broad market to experience a downdraft of anywhere between 6% and 10%,â€ Stoltzfus said in a note published Monday. â€œIn our experience the markets prefer that Washingtonâ€™s Capitol Hill have enough checks and balances in place to keep political power out of just one partyâ€™s hands.â€

â€œIt is thought by not just a few folks on Main Street as well as on Wall Street that if tomorrowâ€™s runoff results in a sweep for the Democrats â€“ providing them with control of the Senate as well as the House â€“ that it would bode ill for business with the likelihood that corporate tax rates could rise substantially,â€ he said.

â€œIn addition, a Democratic sweep in Georgia would likely see a boost in new government program creation and spending at a time when many voters, market participants and business leaders are concerned about the sizable level of debt that the Treasury has had to take on to provide a financial â€˜bridge over troubled waterâ€™ via fiscal stimulus,â€ he added.

Republicans currently control 50 seats in the Senate, while Democrats control 48. This means that a Democratic victory for both seats would give the party the majority in the chamber when including Vice President-elect Kamala Harrisâ€™s ability to cast tie-breaking votes."

Ethos:

Why am I worthy enough to share my story here amongst so many hero's and zero's? Because I'm a person, and my experience, my choices, and perception of the world, has value. Because I've thought about stocks every day this year. I've checked Robinhood an average of 7 days a week this year. I've read r/wallstreetbets everyday this year for over an hour, with very occasional deviations to the other r/ finance subs r/theatagang, r/options, investopedia, youtube's kamikaze cash. Autistic? I still don't really understand what autism is, even though I've tried to wrap my head around it, and read plenty about it. The new normal is being an anti social weirdo with a mask on. So I really can't say if i'm on the spectrum or not. 

My game's better than some, worse than others, and you can too.

Origins:

A friend told me about Robinhood in 2016. I'm customer # 994k. I was instantly hooked. I used my pay check money to buy up 1500 AMD, 500 SQ, 50 UI, 50 Tesla, ATVI, NVDA. But I wussed out one day and sold every thing to pay off a credit card in late 2017. Brutal!! 2018 and 2019 I slogged through, carrying on with my life long carpentry journey, (A trade that has been my compass from age 20 until today at 34.) unable to save or pay off anything but minimums even at $40 an hour. I was putting everything I earned + maxed out credit cards into my personal house remodel.

It was the dawn of 2020. I was determined to start again. So I dropped 3k into Robinhood with a fresh philosophy and goal.

New rules. Never sell stock. Only buy stock, (with a few exceptions). Don't cash anything out until account is over 100k, (Despite an over 30k cc balance). /Never pull out.

2020 Plays that got me warmed up:

3k worth of nio and vslr stock, turned into 2k worth after the March crash. I wanted to try options. Because of my rule, never sell stock, I borrowed 1k from a friend, and haven't made another deposit since. 1k in visa calls turned to 4k, vslr calls +18k, more vslr + 25k, apple 16k to 32k back to 16k FD 2 day trade, lost 30k on poorly timed nio calls and nkla puts somehow.(Buy longer dated contracts!) Instead of chasing my losses trying to earn it back as fast as i'd lost it, I took a deep breath and entered my current positions.

Current positions:

* 10@ JD $95 1/15/21 Call 4.15
* 10@ AMD $110 4/16/21 Call 3.30
* 100@ ICLN $30 4/16/21 Call .40
* 100@ LIT $55 4/16/21 Call 4.50

*Processing img wabexltlyf861...*

Started with 10's of contracts at a time, now i'm at 100's at a time, after i cash out my current positions around March - April, I hope to be buying 1000's at a time. Looking for the currently unhyped gems, far out of the money, 1/2 a year out+ contracts, with some day trading weeklies along the way if inspiration strikes. Planing on maintaining a 50/50 or 75/25 stock/options ratio in the account. Just turned on margin, only 12k available because most of my account is currently unrealized options contracts. Currently using 100% of the margin.

A month back, a post revealed WSB holds over 5-6% of TOTAL available shares. When the shorts have to cover, they need available shares to cover. If no one sells, moon shot right? Not exactly. 

On large moves, people will cash out along the way, keeping the price down. The fewer people that sell, the higher the price is forced until the orders are filled. So how do we get it to the moon? Set an order to sell ALL your GME shares (no expiration) at $420.69. Set it and forget it. When Cohen and Co. refuse to sell, and diamond hand endure, there won't be enough shares to cover the shorts. If the majority of the available shares are at $420.69, Melvin Capital will be forced to bow to the autistic strength of WSB.

Happy New Year, let's retire in 2021."

I really work with kids with Autism spectrum disorder for a living, itâ€™s called ABA. It is amazing what it can do for these kids, it can take many of them and after many years, bring them to a level of function that you canâ€™t tell them apart from other people their age. Itâ€™s their only lifeline to a real future. 

This has been a really hard year for families that have kids with autism. COVID has cucked the school system, which through off tons of kids in therapy into chaos mode as routines were destroyed and changed constantly. ASD kids need their hard set routines. Many parents lost jobs and could no longer afford copayments to keep their kids in ABA therapy, leading to regression of gained skills. 

So donâ€™t forget share those sweet tendies this year if you can. Donate to the Autism charity or organization you want to, It makes a big difference. 

This is WSB so I have no choice to gloat about my measly 10 bagger this year, got in 10k shares of MMEDF at .33 in my Roth IRA. Sold some so that I got my money back and can no literally no longer lose money on it. My remaining shares are riding this ðŸš€to the fucking ðŸŒ with no risk.

Full text of Xi Jinping's 2021 New Year address,1609461903,fookinlegend3,8,"""Comrades, friends, ladies and gentlemen, greetings to you all! 

The year 2021 is arriving. From China's capital Beijing, I extend my New Year wishes to you all! 

2020 was an extraordinary year. Facing the sudden coronavirus pandemic, we put people and their lives first to interpret the great love among humans. With solidarity and resilience, we wrote the epic of our fight against the pandemic. 

During the days when we addressed the hardships together, we saw the heroic spirit of marching straight to the frontlines, holding posts with tenacity, taking responsibility to get through thick and thin, sacrifices with bravery, and touching moments of helping each other. 

From medical workers to the people's army, from scientific researchers to community workers, from volunteers to those who built the projects, from seniors to youths born after the 1990s and 2000s, numerous people fulfilled their missions at the cost of their lives and protected humanity with sincere love. 

They pooled their drops of strength into tremendous power and built an iron wall to safeguard lives. Many figures marched ahead without hesitation, many relays were accomplished hand in hand, many scenes showed touching moments, all these vividly illustrate the great spirit of fighting against the pandemic.  

Greatness is forged in the ordinary. Heroes come from the people. Every person is remarkable! 

Our sympathy goes to all the unfortunate ones infected with the coronavirus! We salute all the ordinary heroes! 

I am proud of our great motherland and people, as well as the unyielding national spirit. Only in hard times can courage and perseverance be manifested. Only after polishing can a piece of jade be finer. We overcame the impact of the pandemic, and made great achievements in coordinating prevention and control and in economic and social development. 

The 13th Five-Year Plan has been accomplished in full. The 14th Five-Year Plan is being comprehensively formulated. We are accelerating the pace to set up a new pattern for development, and are deeply implementing high-quality development. 

China is the first major economy worldwide to achieve positive growth, and its GDP in 2020 is expected to step up to a new level of 100 trillion yuan. China has seen a good harvest in grain production for 17 years in a row. China has seen breakthroughs in scientific explorations like the Tianwen-1 (Mars mission), Chang'e-5 (lunar probe), and Fendouzhe (deep-sea manned submersible). Construction of the Hainan Free Trade Port is proceeding with vigor. 

We also defeated severe flooding. With the military and civilians heedless of danger and difficulty, and standing in unity, we managed to minimize the damage of the floods. 

I inspected 13 provincial-level regions and was glad to see people carefully implementing coronavirus prevention and control measures, racing against time to resume work and production, and sparing no efforts to advance innovation. 

Everywhere were vibrant scenes of confident, resilient people making the most of every minute. In 2020, China made the historic achievement of establishing a moderately prosperous society in all respects and achieved decisive success in eradicating extreme poverty. 

We launched the final assault on the fortress of entrenched rural poverty, and cracked this ""hardest nut.""

Through 8 years, under the current standard, China has eradicated extreme poverty for the nearly 100 million rural people affected, and all the 832 impoverished counties have shaken off poverty. 

These years, I have visited 14 contiguous areas of dire poverty. The unremitting efforts of the folks and the wholehearted contribution of the poverty-eradication cadres often come to my mind. 

We still need to stay tenacious like a bamboo deeply rooted in the rocks, keep our feet on the ground, and work hard to paint a magnificent picture of rural vitalization, and steadily march ahead towards the goal of common prosperity.   

This year, we celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, among others, and 30 years of the development and opening-up of Pudong in Shanghai.  As I stood on the southern coast as the spring tide surged and on the colorful bank of the Huangpu River, my mind was filled with a myriad of thoughts. 

Pilot trials have become models and leading forces, and explorations to innovate have become leading forces of innovation. The opening-up and reform has created miracles of development. In the future, we should further deepen reform and expand opening-up with greater courage, and create more ""Stories of Spring."" 

We are not alone on the Great Way and the whole world is one family. After a year of hardship, we can understand more than ever the significance of a community with a shared future for mankind. 

I had many phone calls with friends from the international community, both old and new, and attended many ""cloud conferences."" What we discussed most was staying united to combat the pandemic. 

We still have a long way to go in pandemic prevention and control. People from all over the world should join hands and support each other to early dispel the gloom of the pandemic and strive for a better ""Earth home."" 

2021 will see the 100th birthday of the Communist Party of China. Its 100-year journey surges forward with great momentum. Its original aspiration remains even firmer one hundred years later. 

From Shikumen in Shanghai to the South Lake in Jiaxing City, the small red boat (where the first CPC congress concluded) bore the great trust of the people and the hope of the nation. The boat has sailed through turbulent rivers and treacherous shoals, and has voyaged across violent tidal waves, becoming a great ship that navigates China's stable and long-term development. 

The CPC bears its eternal great cause in mind, and the centenary only ushers in the prime of life. We adhere to putting people at the center, stay true to our original aspiration, keep our mission well in mind, break the waves and sail out for our journey ahead, and we will certainly realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. 

At the historic crossroad of the ""Two Centenary Goals,"" the new journey of comprehensively building a modern socialist country is about to start. The road ahead is long; striving is the only way forward. We have strived, broken through brambles and thorns, and crossed ten thousand rivers and thousands of mountains. 

We will continue to strive, march ahead with courage, and create brighter glory! At just this moment, the festive lanterns have been lit, and family members gather for reunion. The New Year is coming. I wish our land to be splendid, our country to be prosperous, and our people to live in peace. I wish you all a harmonious, smooth and auspicious year, full of happiness! 

Thank you!â€"

Every day our beloved stock sinks and our crew becomes smaller and fucking smaller. Many fallen brothers have been lost this week and we must ensure that we do not lose any more blood moving forward into the new year. Today, I spent the entire trading day obsessively dollar cost averaging on my PLTR stock position and figured out an effective strategy on how to effectively limit your downside risk exposure on this stock while it continues to tank. Get the fuck out of your option positions and stick to buying this stonk only until we start to see an actual reversal. If you are not already deep in the fucking hole already, dedicate 30% of your funds to your entry point and as it continues to drop every 20 cents consistently buy more shares. When PLTR rallies on the day chart then sell a portion or half of your position when you break even and wait for it to continue dropping and then continue to dollar cost averaging on your position accordingly. I literally did this shit all day and actually ended the day slightly in the green with the after hours coming through. I doubt anyone actually reads all of this but if you do Godspeed and I wish you all a happy, healthy, and prosperous New Year! Current position 1,000 PLTR shares @ $23.68"

Ok so this is bugging me the fuck out. basically this is the 1/15 GME OTM calls for today and on the 2nd to the last column is the % change for the day. now GME swung up and down \~2% throughout the day ending the day with a big dump. 

I watched the price action on my OTM calls all day and noticed that prices did change violently as the stock swung violently. But towards the end of the day when the stock dumped, options price did not change at all. If fact it went up a little.

From my understanding, any far OTM FDs get wrecked if the stock price goes down just a little bit. but this time it went up??? I'm just wondering what could have caused call options starting from 27 all the way to 40 caused the price to go up. I understand it could be like a liquidity issue but then who's buying all these options??? Could it be the institution?? I'm hella confused. If you have any idea please comment below."

ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€JUICY GME DD ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ + Reason behind ICR change,1609464788,0ptimusPrim0,45,"Alright earlier today I wrote an Erotica novel of DD, which was mainly a preface / foreplay to this. The idea was to be able to finish it all in one go, but I ran out of my supply...

All jokes aside, life came up and I thought I could finish it rather soon but that didnâ€™t happen. 

Many of you have an attention span that is longer than you could last in bed, so Iâ€™ll just spill the DD here. I highly encourage you to go back to that post because Iâ€™m trying to coordinate and a make a push for charities, donation ideas, and creating a social media push / trend to not only round up undiagnosed Autists out there, but to also to send batman signals to #TheDogFather Ryan Cohen.


The best â€œnewsâ€ can be slaughtered by poor presentation. I have doubts with Sherman up there, perhaps theyâ€™ll use someone effective. ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸

#DD points: ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

1) GME is making a bigger push to becoming PC oriented, not just games and accessories, but parts as well. 

2) The reason Sherman was able to qualify GME as â€œessential businessâ€ was because of the few PC stuff they had. Then they sold out of that PC stuff in March and after that they were basically open because of PC qualification despite not having any PC items. By switching to â€œtechnologyâ€ category, Sherman would have to qualify them into that. The way he has been able to do so is for 2 reasons. 

A) To ensure that theyâ€™ll stay open in similar lockdowns. This will probably not be mentioned...but the dude did push for his stores to remain open and got backlash for it. Already tarnished a damaged image. 

B) Change business model and get in that Tech Train.


3) OmniChannel experience. 

4) GME has signed contracts with â€œabout 6â€ vendors and providers â€œa couple which were just recently.â€ That number was a ball park # off the top of their mind. These include MSI, NewEgg and so on. 

5) You will be able to outright buy gaming PCs in stores and / or just order any part you may need. Theyâ€™ve ran small trials for these and plan on rolling it out to stores at different times. Unfortunately not every store will have the same experience/ products based on demographic/ size...but they should still be able to order and ship to home or store pick up. 

6) Stores will have dedicated areas for PC experience. Ok letâ€™s be realistic, most stores are the size a studio...so the PC area will be a house for ants. 

But if you check out local GME stores and see empty display areas / locked glass with nothing in it, this is where it is probably going to be dedicated. 

7) Even if you buy $10 card with $5 certificate, youâ€™re not hurting GME. All those cards have been paid for before they got on the wall. Youâ€™re helping money come back, plus the goal is that people will spend more money. 

The goal from my 1st post with push of pro memberships wasnâ€™t to rely on the $15 or $20...and have that as the savior. 

The idea is that with more memberships, you have more leads, and you have people who are more likely to buy products from you. Youâ€™ve now successfully pried someone from going a bigger retailer or online merchant. 

8) Buy memberships for other people. You can also buy memberships for business such as daycare / hospitals etc. At the very least they can have a physical magazine delivered on a monthly basis ($20 version) even if they never choose to use certificates. 

9) Pro Rewards:
#digital gamers benefit hugely. 
Remember those PSN / Steam etc cards, there is 40pts for every dollar spent on those as opposed to 20 pts on everything else.

Why does this matter? Faster points to redeem certificates for yourself or charities already affiliated with GME. 

Every 5k can be redeemed for $5 certificate or donated to charities. 

If you just recently signed up, you got 10K points already, plus welcome $5 coupon. Your 1st official $5 certificate will be available 1st of each month... so you may have up $20 available pretty soon...

10) GME now offers their own CC, which is available to use the same day. They also offer flex pay options from 2 different vendors who allow you to qualify from your phone and make payments ...GME isnâ€™t taking this risk, they get paid from the vendors, customer pays the vendor. 

They also have a rent to own program, with minimum of $120+. 

Final points:

Most customers are buying for other people, that isnâ€™t going to change. So while e-commerce is huge, some Karens will always need to show up to store...

But GME sells â€œused gamesâ€ for nearly same price as new or more expensive than new games. They donâ€™t make this decision, they sign contracts that canâ€™t reduce price on these games until x amount of time...

But GME barely offers any $$$ for my product.

Hi there, they are a business, the most important thing for a business is to be in profit. 

##How long 1 minute is depends on which side of the bathroom door youâ€™re on...

Letâ€™s talk a quick lesson of value vs worth.

Your PSP might be worth $100 to you, but it only has a a value of $5 to GME. Why? Because for every 1 person that comes in looking for a PSP, they have 15 others trying to trade in. After they reach their limit of trade in, wtf are they going to do? Collect every PSP at the price you want them to? So thatâ€™s part of why you get offered low prices.

Thereâ€™s other things involved. They have bills to pay, electricity, rent, wages, medical benefits, legal fees, alarm / security, maintenance on commercial grade AC/ventilation and many more. Oh yea, they also provide people with a safe place to trade in without risking getting robbed, shot, or killed. 

When any business closes, itâ€™s not just those employees who lose their job. The services that that business relies on (mentioned above) now lose a customer and revenue as well. There is less stores for that AC company to send people out to...which means less money for them, which leads to more lost jobs. 

And you know what caused it? That lazy bum who chose the comfort of purchasing from home from an online merchant etc. Thereâ€™s much more to this and this is just the tip of the iceberg when people choose how you do business and shop. Thereâ€™s pros and cons to everything. Iâ€™m not saying never order online, but try to keep a balance. Support your local businesses when you can. 


TL;DR:

ICE changed to Tech because they are changing their ways, and going more PC oriented. Theyâ€™ve signed contracts with vendors and providers. More focus to PC gaming, include actual gaming computers, and parts that can be ordered.

In fact although her ARKQ which has tesla has seen gains, it has overshadowed her ARKG which has her biotech sciencey genomic etf. Year to date that portfolio has made super saiyan gains at 174% at the time of writing this.

Now in her ARKG the number one holding spot weighted at 6.8% is Pacific Bioscience. That stock has gone in 6 months almost 1000% (yes, i wrote that correctly you retards). $3-&gt; $26.

Now there is a company which claims to be able to do the same genomic technology (mapping of genomes, idk too smart for me, go look it up- can break down your DNA to see the profile) more efficiently in cost and accuracy. (BIONANO GENOMICS). If you google Bionano Genomics the last few days has been gaining traction because the stock has risen from ~0.60 to 1-2 dollars and as of market close 4 dollars. The main reason for this gain has been a study released a week ago from a group of nerds at the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium compared PACIFIC BIOSCIENCES and BIONANO absolutely curb stomped them

Vanguard also bought 5.5 million shares. And as you know, these are the stuck up nerds who your wife will marry after divorcing you as well as her boyfriend after you, will marry. These kids are the same kids who top post on r/investing and hate ðŸŒˆ ðŸ» ðŸš€ and tendies. Theyd rather cash out when their penises are limp.

Now if this company gets FDA approval which they are trying to do since they hired a medical director 4 months ago to help them with this process. Dr. Alka Chaubey has helped another company pass FDA APPROVAL BEFORE. Bionano Sciences will go parabolic. And will probably see similar gains to Pacific Bio, while having a smaller market cap.

Why GME MIGHT CONTINUE DROPPING in January and why you should continue ðŸ’Žâœ‹ your shares and roll out Jan/Apr calls,1609467831,YsDivers,70,"Okay so you retards have probably read some posts about how institutions are going to drive the price down hard today to make their 2020 performance look as nice as possible. A lot of you tards theorized that the price could start going up tomorrow because of this but remember, the shorts are watching us

Remember this every time you read any post or comment about GME on this sub

We already know you fucks are paper hands and that a ton of you guys sold after Q3 er in Dec since people genuinely thought the squeeze might happen then but the share price dropped

I predict the shorts might continue dropping the price throughout January because sentiment is so high for that time and cause more people to sell

I'm telling you to fucking hold because we will get those tendies

Now why am I telling you to roll out Jan and Apr calls? Because you guys are still too fucking jumpy on the squeeze date and squeeze duration

Listen the Volkswagen infinity squeeze lasted less than a week because Porsche owned a ridiculous amount of shares by themselves so the price violently went up until Porsche decided to sell

Since GME ownership is spread so thin, people will be selling off at 30, 40, 50, etc at various points up to 300-400 (my peak price target). This means shorts will be able to cover slowly one at a time but also that the squeeze will happen over a period of 3-6 MONTHS like Overstock and Tesla in 2013

If you have Jan or Apr calls, you will almost certainly miss the peak of the squeeze if it even happens before then (unlikely imo)

I HIGHLY suggest selling calls soon and BUYING SHARES to ðŸ’Žâœ‹at least another full year

or rolling out your calls to Jan 2022 expiry whatever strike you want because ideally, you want a buffer of 45 days + 3-6 months between the start of the squeeze and expiry, in order to capture the entire squeeze and not have theta decay eat into your gains

Jan 2022 expiry means you're hoping the catalyst to squeeze is icr conference (Jan), holidays sales report (Jan) (both unlikely imo), Q4 er (March), Board vote (June), Q1 ER (June/July) and Q2 er (Sept/Oct)

Playing Jan or Apr means you're only betting on a few events triggering the squeeze and you won't even get the full thing

It's important to remember that even though Ryan Cohen is able to turn GME around, making software and transforming the company into a digital focused one takes a lot of time especially if the GameStop coders are really bad (which they are, Silicon Valley engineers are many, many magnitudes smarter and faster than typical non tech corporation ones, I've been a software engineer at both types of companies)

Since the transformation will take a long time, the fruits of Cohen labour would only be apparent in a much later er so I HIGHLY recommend shares and just liquidating any calls with &lt; 2022 expiry

Currently the game is in phase one where you buy real life locations within the game for real world money and this will mean that any land you own will be yours in the game to do whatever on. Furthermore the price of land varies from country to country so the USA cost the most at the moment where as countries like Estonia cost very little and these prices will always be fluctuating so why not get involved and spend most of your money in the process.

due to the cares act pasting earlier in 2020 you are able to take forbearance and not have to pay back the missed payments until the end of your loan. 

Think about it, you basically get an interest free loan for 30 God damn years.

Example: My mortgage is $1300 now even if you were a boring ass boomer excited about your 7% annual returns after 30 years you would accumulate $118,751 after the 30 years.

[PBW is in an uptrend and the energy sector had a big correction this week. Next week could be a good time to get in.](https://preview.redd.it/s406syyftm861.png?width=860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=209595abc3e848f64d7b7766e4ddd0816947279a)

*Processing img wj8kbxawsm861...*

So, here's why you should buy PBW over any other green energy ETF. 

1) It has exposure to both solar and EV. A lot of these green energy ETFs are only solar. They completely leave out EV, which is going to be massive. PBW gives you exposure to both parts of the sector, unlike many other ETFs.

2) It has memes and majority of the stocks are small cap. As mentioned, small caps make up 61.91% of the ETF and its got some meme stocks. Biden is going to become president in a month and he is all for green energy. These memes and small caps might see massive growth when Biden starts funding green energy and passing green energy policies. For this reason, I think the ETF may explode and its important to get in before Biden is president. I suspect the green energy sector will have a lot of momentum during Biden's term.

3) Invesco made this ETF. Sound familiar? They made QQQ. I think people will flock to this ETF in the future when everyone wants to jump into green energy, after Biden sets the sector on fire.

I'd suggest buying what I did, the longest dated calls. There is lots of talk about a market crash in the coming months, so you want to have time for PBW to recover if we do crash. I think the green energy sector is going to rally like crazy soon. **It has already gone up 203% in a year though.** You could argue it is overpriced, but I believe this is an emerging sector and has much more room to grow, especially with a president pumping the sector.

Some background. I am a minimalist, never had any issues managing my money, am experienced and sought after in my trade so I pick my exact days and hours. Currently work 13 hours on Saturdays and Sundays. Super low outgoings, make good money, always have solid savings. Monday-friday off for my hobbies, social life, mental health. Normally I would travel 6 months of the year but with the pandemic I can't so I don't know what to do with my money. 

I have never had debt, moved out of home at 16. Don't understand the way people navigate and spend. I think I could effectively retire on a very small amount of money, am not greedy and already have really nice things. 

So I guess I feel like I am in a great position to at the very least look into trading. Even if I spent 6 months researching but never made a trade I would be happy. Or maybe I yolo all my savings for the Lol's?"

GME with Greeks for the Geeks,1609474941,Furnitureman80085,39,"ETHOS: I've been scalping stocks for four years. From the start, I've planned on making a living from it. YTD I've finished 2020 at 230%. (Only played tesla once and lost on it.) This is my career path and my rent, car, bills, wife, and step child all depend on it.

PATHOS: fuck banks. Fuck them fuck them fuck them fuck them. Anybody who's tried to swim in the market knows that big money controls money. WSB has caught two such banks with their shorts down. Melvin and BOA have their shorts around their ankles on GME. 

LOGOS: The market is not a gentle place. And what's right does not always prevail. My 12/31 16.50 calls turned to equity today and now I hold $20k+ in GME. I'm right, GME gang is right, the people are right and the banks are wrong. 

I'm in this trade because I'm waiting for a squeeze. I don't think the banks are even sweating yet. My $20k and WSB's $20 million aren't enough. 

I need someone to explain to me how WE can flip GameStop. How are we going to hold enough shares that the banks will pay upwards of $100 for them?"

GME Squeeze,1609475753,redcedar53,35,"If this GME short squeeze is so â€œwell-knownâ€, I donâ€™t understand why some hedge fund (or a team of) is not buying up 70% of the shares like Porsche did and just not release them. Sure thatâ€™s 635M, and quite a bit of play, but thatâ€™s pretty much a guaranteed $5.7B profit (easier to spread the risk if multiple funds team up). The news will be quite the â€œshockâ€ no one would see it coming and there will be short panic? This just seems like such an easy play for the big boys, no?

The funds donâ€™t necessary have to believe in GME and its future. Just the technical set up and the number of shares shorted. This would be a pure numbers play.

Or do we think this is already happening in the background (hence these large â€œunknownâ€ purchases that weâ€™ve been seeing lately)?

I am not looking at my portfolio but I have 10c, 15c, 25c all april. I have averaged up 5 times. 

I am not a smart man. I follow trends and what I believe in. I did the same thing as my guy u /deepvalue. I have been into every gamestop store i can drive to in 5 hours, even down into the morass of the MS delta. The real deal is that what they are doing is working, at least kind of. 

.. same day stuff is fucked because they use door dash and door dash gives first name and last name first letter.   Well I tried that, my name is the 7th most common name in the world, and my last name starts with S... so yea, I got mixed up and fucked, not because if GME but because of $DASH. Turns out that $DASH labels orders by first name, and last initial. Would have worked fine if my name was zack zak. 
I hung out and talked to the manager after going to the store to get my shit straight... he is out if so much store stock., and corporate has no clue when he can get more... I'm not even talking about consoles, he is out of damn pokemon BS. I asked about some stupid Thor hammer ... yea.. back  ordered for at least a month, if even then.

The past week I have seen GME shit talk and FUD from bad actors out the wood work. Accounts made in DEC, reactivated accounts, with no other DD or up votes on what we think. 

Fuck these guys. 

If you are GME gang ...DO NOT SELL YOUR SHARES!
Stand by the DD that the smarts on this sub provided months ago. 

I know it's hard when you see days down. This is a solid play. Even if there is no VW like squeeze, we will still see a $40-50 price because GME is actually worth that. I think more like 70ish if we can vote in RC. 

In closing: look at the users here spouting  FUD , look at the DD months back, look at why you bought into this in the first place. 

Ask yourself this weekend: can I take the 20% up and down, do I want gamestop  there for me, do I want to give BAC And Melvin my tendies? 

Well, when they give me red arrows, I the shade with small buys.

Do not buy 100 shares. Buy 1, or 2. Buy what you can buy. This is a win and a win that you can give to a solid company. 

Throw off the Melvin  FUD the BAC fud , I say  GME is  America And America is GME...

Jan 5 - Most important day for the 2021 stock market,1609492981,pgh1979,9,"On Jan 5 Georgia elects its 2 Senators. If Democrats win both Biden can pass tax increases through the Senate and that will hit the stock market.

Interestingly enough Jan 5 is also when the new Congress certifies the electoral votes and elects Boden as President. If Biden dies before Jan 5, Congress can refuse to recognize electoral votes cast for Biden as automatically transferring to Harris. At that point the election is in dispute and it falls to the House of Representatives to elect the President. Interestingly in this election each State delegation gets 1 vote - California gets one vote and so does South Dakota. Republicans control 26 of the State delegations in the current Cingress and 27 in the incoming Congress.

So TLDR If Biden dies before Jan 5, Trump can get elected President.

If Democrats win the Senate, we have a Trump Presidency with a Democrat house and Senate.

Why Salesforce ($CRM) is going to be the next SAP,1609497805,Mbhound,58,"I got two goals here. One is for you to understand what Salesforce and SAP really do instead of just ""cloud"" and ""software"" and why Salesforce will become like SAP. The second is to tell you what to expect with CRM price and how to make tendies.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First you gotta understand what exactly SAP does and what happened with their stock. SAP is one of the largest software companies which focus on ERP. What the fuck is ERP you might ask? ERP is what other businesses use to track business resources. This ranges from everything such as planning and optimizing manufacturing capacity to dealing with payroll for employees. Basically companies don't want to create their own software for handling these wide range of tasks and pay SAP a shit load of money to do it for them. Where's the problem you might ask? Unless you are involved with one of these companies that use SAP, it's difficult to understand what the experience is like. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/htsfvr8uro861.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db3b665c95ce5d62639a4dc0e5d9469a08510cbd

Basically a company pays SAP to use their software for dealing with one of these areas of ERP. This generally works fine since SAP has used their business management software with a lot of companies for the same tasks. The issue is when one of these companies want to [customize the software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning#Disadvantages) to meet unique demands for the company. This re-engineering process to fit the ERP system for many tasks ends up costing more for a company and wasting a lot of time and money. Interestingly enough, you can ask almost any business about their experience with SAP and they will all say that they're unhappy even though they use their software. So what you might ask, wouldn't SAP still be generating tons of revenue? Well yes but more of these companies are moving away from this way of doing ERP as it is an inflexible approach. This is becoming replaced by more loosely connected systems utilizing cloud instead of having a one solves all solution.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ugj07ez0to861.png?width=984&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c45c19bcdd0e10bd643286730aa3a2beeec0ae20

Let's look at how their financial earnings and stock price have reflected this. In the past two years this stock has traded relatively sideways with some really bad drops. Around May to August their stock price went up 60% do to the hype around cloud companies benefiting from COVID. However it has obviously taken a really bad fall when October earnings were announced. They claimed that there was slower recovery than anticipated for many of its clients. However I suspect that many of these companies have been looking to shift away from SAP as the pandemic has shown the importance of the flexibility of these systems. By looking at their past quarters, you can see that their quarterly revenue has been flat around the 8 billion range and the company is clearly having a difficult time changing their business model. Other cloud companies are replacing their solutions as SAP's clients move away from their software even though SAP is trying to shift to [modern cloud technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP#Corporate_restructuring). Generally though companies have a hard time changing their business approach from the old way of doing things to the new way of doing things. 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now the important part. What the fuck does SAP's troubles have to do with Salesforce. As you may have guessed from the ticker Salesforce provides CRM or customer relationship management. [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) is a specific area in ERP dealing with customer services. For example a company may want a software for their call center or to automate a marketing effort. Salesforce provides software to do this along with analytics of this data so that these businesses can make informed decisions.

As you may have already guessed Salesforce is facing some similar problems that SAP deal with. When a company decides to expand their CRM software to deal with more parts of their business, the inflexibility and costs quickly become apparent. [For example, many corporations only use CRM systems on a partial basis and less than 40 percent of companies have high end-user adoption rates.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management#Criticism) Again if you are not familiar with software development and companies using these software vendors it is difficult to fully understand these troubles. I would strongly recommend researching the issues of customizing ERP or CRM software for a specific company if you are not convinced. While Salesforce tries to provide an all in one solution for their clients, customization becomes complicated and prices become costly. These customizations become difficult to do and take a lot of time, planning, and money. Companies are becoming more inclined to take a different approach for building these systems. In a lot of these cases it is easier for a business to build their own system in the cloud using products from companies such as Microsoft or Amazon for more customizability. 

Another big issue is the concern over customer data with CRM systems. A company might opt to develop their own CRM systems where they can ensure that customer data is obeying customer privacy laws and allows them to have more control over private data. This can help build a better relationship with the customer. Privacy issues over customer data has obviously become a big issue in 2020.

Furthermore, Salesforce has been trying to get into more areas with [recent acquisitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce). Similar to SAP, I suspect that Salesforce will crush over their own weight as they try to expand their company. One good example of this is their recent acquisition of Slack. Slack does not really fit any of Salesforce ecosystem and is really just an attempt to expand into a different area. Slack has a lot of competition from Microsoft teams and other companies which can do what Slack does but better. 

Business will start to move away from Salesforce similar to SAP. This is not to say that they be completely independent as Salesforce does make some parts of the businesses easier. However there seems to be a strong resemblance to SAP based on what I know from inside of a corporation using both SAP and Salesforce and the many issues they face when they try and customize their solutions.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So how can we use this information to print tendies? The expectation is that Salesforce will eventually slow their growth down while stock is overhyped due to being a cloud company and start to fall or go sideways like SAP. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vl629rb14p861.png?width=927&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4282ffef17bd83b9a62a7f196974d0113511b1d5

Basically the idea is to try and play puts, especially around earnings. If Salesforce misses their guidance then it could the stock in a serious reversal especially for a cloud company with a lot of hype. The next earnings will be early March.

You can also try and play longer term puts but the stock is fairly volatile like SAP and I would only do this if you see the price go up significantly.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr; buy puts in march

The TSLA 2021 Trade Plan,1609508025,notlikethis1994,56,"**TLDR:**

Tesla enters 2021 with huge tailwinds. Bullish for the first half of the year. More caution in the second half as competing EV products start entering the market at an accelerating pace. Biggest risk is the market discounting the effect of strong EV competition starting in 2021. Avoid shorting TSLA.

# The 2021 TSLA trade plan

## What moves the stock?

Knowing that TSLA is decoupled from its business metrics, an inquisitive investor will wonder what drives the stock's price. The answer is partially uncovered by understanding who owns the stock. According to Macroaxis.com, as of December 30th, Institutions own 42.52% of Tesla's stock, the Public (i.e. Retail Investors) owns 37.46%, and Insiders own 20.02%.

&gt;Institutional investors aren't selling

TSLA's institutional investor base consists of large passive funds such as funds tracking the S&amp;P500 (which recently added TSLA) to more active hedge funds specializing in innovation and growth. Passive funds increase the buying pressure of TSLA while adding minimal selling pressure. Today, the majority of the workforce regularly contributes their salary to passive funds for retirement and said funds are unlikely to trim their holdings of a stock unless during an infrequent rebalancing event. The active funds that remain invested in TSLA tend to have celestial expectations for the company and are also unlikely to sell at this valuation. For example, billionaire fund manager Ron Baron believes that Tesla, currently at a $659 billion market cap, should be a $2 trillion dollar company. Another major fund manager, Cathie Wood, gives TSLA a 2024 price target of $7,000. Assuming minimal changes in total float, that equates to almost a $7 trillion dollar market cap!

So TSLA's institutional investor base are hardly sellers of TSLA and still believe there is significant room for the stock to run despite its incredible 2020 performance.

&gt;Retail investors aren't selling

What about TSLA's retail investor base? This question is easily answered. Over the years, TSLA has built a diehard fanbase that has equally high, if not higher, expectations of the company than some of the institutional investors. Some people believe the company's CEO, Elon Musk, has developed a cult-of-personality. Tesla's cult-like fanbase manifests online as a large number of YouTube channels and online forums dedicated to the company, and in a broader sense, Elon Musk. For example, the main Tesla subreddit, r/ teslamotors, has more than 901,000 subscribers at the time of writing.

&gt;Insiders aren't selling

Of the remaining 20% of TSLA stock, the majority is held by Elon Musk and he's certainly not eager to sell noticeable quantities of his holdings given the ensuing bad PR.

So if investors are hesitant to sell TSLA, TSLA is bound to appreciate aggressively every time there's good news and appreciate slowly in the absence of news as passive funds and its ardent fanbase continue to buy in. In other words, TSLA is a heavily news-driven stock with a heavy bias for upside.

This is exactly what we saw in 2020. TSLA entered the year having solved its Model 3 production problems while managing to maintain solvent. This act alone unceremoniously discarded a dark cloud over the company on whether it'll manage to produce cars at scale before its heavy debt-burden catches up with the company's treasury. With that, the path was clear for a string of good news to catapult the stock to grandiose heights. They included the opening of the Shanghai factory, the 5-for-1 stock split, the S&amp;P500 inclusion, and record sales and deliveries in the third quarter. Even good news from the tangentially-related company SpaceX, who Elon Musk is also the CEO of, has been positive for TSLA.

# The Plan and Headwinds

Tesla will enter 2021 with boosted by tailwinds from its 2020 success. If Tesla maintains its current pace of execution, ceteris paribus (fancy business major speak for ""all other things being equal""), its stock price is expected to continue to appreciate and befuddle its critics. Tesla is finally able to produce Model 3's at scale, has a foothold in the Chinese market, and is readying to launch the Cybertruck to a red-hot North American pickup truck market. In addition, like Pavlov's dogs, 2020 has conditioned investors to not bet against TSLA with the stock shrugging off multiple negative news events like the COVID-19 pandemic, the expected post-S&amp;P500 inclusion sell-off (which never happened), and the Apple EV announcement.

**In 2021, it's recommended to continue to avoid shorting Tesla, no matter how tempting.**

With that said, there are significant headwinds facing Tesla that any long positions should be aware of. Tesla currently has an 81.66% market share of the US EV market. The biggest risk going into 2021 and beyond is the significant ramp up in EV and battery technology competition from legacy auto manufacturers. Tesla's stock price has only emboldened the executive teams of these companies to pour significant resources into their EV businesses. GM, Volkswagen, and Ford are leading the pack. GM has invested $27 billion into its EV business and is planning to launch 30 EVs by 2025. Two EVs have already been announced: the Cadillac Lyriq and the Hummer EV, with both receiving an overwhelmingly positive public response. GM has also developed an in-house battery technology called Ultium that's the central pillar for its 2025 plan. A step above GM, Volkswagen is investing $41 billion into its EV business and plans to launch 70 EVs by 2030. It's also aggressively investing in battery technology. For example, Volkswagen has a large stake in QuantumScape, a company that claims to be developing a revolutionary solid-state battery technology. Last but not least, Ford is investing $11 billion into its EV business and plans to launch 40 EVs by 2022. Deliveries of its flagship EV, the well-received Mustang Mach-E, is already underway. An honorable mention goes to Apple, which plans to start production of its own EV in 2024.

If TSLA is a news-driven stock, a growing string of negative news about the company's shrinking North American and European market share should apply downward pressure on price. The worry is that investors are so exuberant about the stock's stellar 2020 performance that the effects of emergent, serious competition from legacy auto manufacturers are heavily discounted.

**In 2021, although it remains very bullish for TSLA going into the first half of the year, it's recommended to avoid aggressively starting or adding more to an existing position in the latter half of the year. This is when the rate of competing EV products entering the North American and European markets is expected to accelerate. Prudent investors should watch how the public reacts to this large structural EV market change before making any moves.**

Palantir and Mithril cool names from LOTR or do they have meanings?,1609510241,Bright_Percentage_39,27,"Conspiracy time;

Palantir:

 'A ***palantÃ­r*** ([/ËˆpÃ¦lÉ™nËŒtÉªÉ™r/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English); *pl.* ***palantÃ­ri***) is a fictional magical [artefact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(fantasy)) from [J. R. R. Tolkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien)'s [Middle-earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth) [legendarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolkien%27s_legendarium). A *palantÃ­r* (from [Quenya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenya) *palan*, 'far; *tir*, 'watch over'[\[T 1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palant%C3%ADr#cite_note-1)) is described as an indestructible [ball of crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_ball), used for communication and to see events in other parts of [Arda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arda_(Middle-earth)), whether past or future.' - Is this what Palantir will do in the future? See the past or future with their powerful programmes?

Mithril:

The scholar of English literature Charles A. Huttar writes that *mithril* was the only mineral that Tolkien invented. He notes that in Tolkien's underworld, whether the [caves at Helm's Deep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glittering_Caves_of_Aglarond) or the mines of Moria, ""beauty and terror \[were\] side by side"".[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithril#cite_note-Huttar_1975-12) Greed for *mithril* could unleash the terror of the [Balrog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balrog), by digging too far down into the dark realm, but at the same time, he writes, the metal was prized for both its beauty and its usefulness, yielding the best armour. He compares the Dwarves' greed for *mithril* with that of the Barrow-wights for treasure, and indeed that of the [dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon) in [*The Hobbit*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit) and [*Beowulf*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf) for gold. In his view, these symbolise the evil ""inherent in the mineral treasures hidden in the womb of Earth"",[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithril#cite_note-Huttar_1975-12) just as mining and metalwork are associated with [Satan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan) in [John Milton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milton)'s [*Paradise Lost*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost) (I, 670-751). Huttar sums up with a reflection on Tolkien's moral vision in the story: just as the characters at every point have to decide for good or ill, so objects have the potential to be both good and evil: ""Mithril is both the greatest of treasures and a deadly bane. 

Does Peter Thiel actually use the names that have meanings behind them on what the company is going to achieve or is it just some cool names chosen from the LOTR universe?

As we can see Mithril can be used for good and ill, will that be the case with Palantir? If it gets in the wrongs hands could that bring a deadly bane or if it gets into the good hands could that bring the greatest treasure?

Does that basically mean I am too retarded or are we going to the moon on this rocket  ðŸš€ ?"

Fulfilling my Ryan Gosling Big Short fantasy by throwing my life savings into DoorDash puts,1609513061,NelsonTingles,386,"DoorDash is currently sitting at $142 per share, down 22% from $182 when retail investors were able to buy at IPO. Only \~10% of its 286M outstanding shares are available to trade due to its lockup period, giving it a float of 20M shares.

Here's where things get interesting. If you take a look at page 91 of their S-1 filing ([Go to page 91 to confirm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm#rom752207_9) ), existing shareholders PRE-IPO purchased 284M shares at $8.73. Company employees who purchased shares at that price are salivating at a current 1,628% profit. Early lockup period expires 90 days after IPO, meaning that 90% of outstanding shares (284M shares once again) that currently can't be traded and were purchased at $8.73 will be released into the market available to trade. Regardless of what you think about valuation and possible future growth of DoorDash (which is already ridiculously overpriced and they had the worst IPO in history), any rational employee will dump their holdings immediately for that 10 bagger profit.

Now considering present conditions, the price action is ridiculous. Looking at the level 2 data, there is almost no retail volume, and any trades made throughout the day are by MMs trying to keep this stock liquid. Volume from the past 2 days has already dropped by 50%. Literally NO ONE wants to buy this POS. The price is pinned at $140, with retail dips that are immediately bought up by manipulation. If you look at the 1 minute chart yesterday, it traded at literally $140 throughout the day and suddenly spiked to 146 in a manner of 3 minutes before slowly settling down to $142. This thing is manipulated as fuck, and as soon as MMs are exhausted it will crash regardless of the aforementioned S-1 filing.

I have 175 contracts of 5/21 $80 puts. I'm betting $87k I can look back at this post in 5 months and pretend I'm reenacting The Big Short as Ryan Gosling. More than likely, I'll probably have to start driving for DoorDash and moonlight sucking weens behind the restaurants I just made a delivery from.

**Options Trading Rules**

Always remember: **â€œBulls Make Money, Bears Make Money,** **Pigs Get Slaughtered****!â€**

1. Open and read these points before every trade you make.

2. Buy options that are no less than 4 weeks from expiring. Ideally, they would have at least 8 weeks until expiration or longer.

3. Buy calls or puts at the money or close to it. 

4. STOP JUMPING INTO STOCKS THAT YOU HAVE NOT MONITORED FOR AT LEAST 1-2 WEEKS.

a. This will give you an idea of what the stock is doing and the type of price action you are stepping into. 

b. If you miss out before entry, move on to another stock. They are plenty of stocks in the sea. 

5. Remember past events or trade outcomes will not determine how a new trade works out. If the stock is not going in the direction you thought it would GET OUT! Do not waste time wondering why and or going against what the price action is saying or doing. 

6. As much as you can, remove your emotions. Become a robot when it comes to trading. 

7. STOP CHASING THE MONEY YOU HAVE LOST!!!!!!!

8. STOP ALLOWING YOURSELF TO HAVE DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR. Its okay to dream just not in stock trading. Take profits when you can. It is okay if you make 5-10% in a trade before pulling the trigger. Not every trade will turn out to be 100% or 1000% return. 

9. Pay attention when Cramer pounds the table about a stock. Buy long dated Calls.

10. YOU NEED VOLUME for a stock to move. If the Volume is not there, move on or check again later."

Three months ago I wrote up a guide on consistently outperforming the S&amp;P500 using Theta Gang strategy. That guide got a lot of positive feedback, and I suggest those who missed it take a look. [How to CONSISTENTLY Outperform the S&amp;P500 using Theta Gang Strategy. A Comprehensive Guide to Wheeling ETFs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz68r4/how_to_consistently_outperform_the_sp500_using/) And if you are truly retarded check out my recent Tips for Noobies. [Top 5 Tips Every Noobie Trader MUST Know.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4ztif/top_5_tips_every_noobie_trader_must_know/)

I've since decided to put my skills to the test and will attempt to double a small $8000 account by the end of 2021 using similar strategies. This will mostly be an educational experience, and I will walk you through all my thought processes and my trades as I make them so hopefully the retards among you can learn a thing or two. And if I blow up the account, that will be entertaining as well, right?

Some of the less experienced among you may think this is a simple feat. The more experienced among you will know achieving such consistently high returns will be an incredibly difficult feat. I put my odds of success somewhere around 20% to be honest. But it will be a good education for both of us. Really, I only need to achieve around 6% return every month to break 100% by the end of the year (after compounding), and put in those terms the task doesn't sound so daunting, does it?

Still, I will be forced to make some very aggressive, downright risky plays in order to make this remotely possible. If my wheeling ETF guide was about a safe, conservative strategy, this guide will be the opposite. Keep that in mind if you are foolish enough to copy my trades. 

Wish me luck... I will need it.

# Basic Strategy

I will not leave any tool off the table here. If I see an opportunity, I will take it. But for the majority of my trades I will be using a very simple strategy. Find high implied volatility stonks and sell options on them. I will typically be selling cash-secured puts since naked calls carry excess risk, which means I want to look for stocks I am generally bullish on long-term.

Using ToS I've set up some very basic filters to scan for promising stocks to trade:

**1) Option Implied Volatility &gt;80% (for tendies)**

**2) Stock Volume &gt;5,000,000 (for liquidity)**

**3) Market Cap &gt;$1B (to comply with WSB rules)**

**4) Stock Price &lt;$82 (collateral maximum)**

Scanning with these filters brings up a lot of familiar names: GME, PLTR, QS, NKLA, LAZR, FCEL, UVXY, ACB, XPEV, SPCE, and so on. In other words, the type of stonks retards like you are buying expensive options on...

# Running the Numbers

I will try to not get too technical and into the weeds with this experiment. I'll be using some very basic math to decide which options to sell. I highly recommend you play around with the numbers on options to really get an intuitive feel for how they work. For example, if I were to ask you what happens to the relative cost of premium ($/day) as DTE increases on an option, what would be your answer? If you don't know, just run some simple numbers to find out...

SPY premium / DTE = $/day

332 / 5 = 66.4

440 / 10 = 44

652 / 21 = 31

1915 / 140 = 13.7

As you can see, premium cost per day decreases as time till expiration increases. (It's more complicated than that of course, but we are keeping it simple here). For that reason I will be doing something I generally don't advocate: Selling weeklies to squeeze a bit of extra juice out of my options. This also means I will be holding them all to expiration to deal with issues like higher gamma.

Here is another simple equation I can use to give me a lot of information:

**(Premium \* 365) / (DTE \* Strike) = Max ROI**

Basically what I'm doing is estimating the returns from selling the same option for an entire year with a 100% success rate. Since I'm aiming for 100% ROI, any options I sell will need to be over 100 in this formula. Of course, I won't have a 100% success rate on my trades, so I should probably aim even higher to give myself some buffer, maybe around 120. Let's try it on some \~ATM options to get a relative comparison of option value:

SPY: 12.2

PSTH: 48.1

GME: 140.5

PLTR: 111.1

QS: 263.7

UVXY: 134.2

Don't put too much stock in these numbers. I'm just using them as a simple comparative tool for judging the profitability of different options.

We can glean even more information from the above number if we multiply it by the Prob. ITM% of course, to get something closer to an ""Expected Value"" for an option, which I will perhaps go into more detail on next month.

Finally I'll be throwing around various other calculations as I go, $/day, ROI/month, premium/collateral, and so on. I will need to watch all of these and more to reach my goal.

# My First Trade

Looking at the stocks in my filter, there are two that really stand out to me: GME and PLTR. That's right, everyones favorite meme stocks!

GameStop is interesting as a short-term play, and has very high IV. But I'm not confident in the company as a long-term play, and would hate to be assigned hundreds of shares of that shitty brick and mortar hellscape. Palantir, on the other hand, has serious growth potential long-term and I would not mind being assigned. It has also been hit hard recently and is at a more reasonable entry level, which also makes it a good choice. **Therefore, I will be trading PLTR as my first play.**

I want to sell an OTM put to give myself some downside protection against a further drop, but not so far OTM that I can't break my 100% ROI goal. Let's plug some of the Jan. 15 options into my formula above to get a breakdown of the potential ROI.

21 strike: 74.2

22 strike: 108.4

22.5 strike: 131.9

23 strike: 155.5

Either the 22 or 22.5 strikes are right near the sweet spot we are looking for in terms of return. Of course conditions will likely change on Monday and I may need to reassess, but at the moment my current play seems to be:

**Sell to Open 3 contracts of PLTR 22p 1/15.**

If Monday opens red it will be even better for us, since we get in at a cheaper price with likely higher IV on top. So I for one am praying for a bloody Monday for Palantir (sorry bagholders).

Of course after selling 3 contracts at 22 strike, we will only have used $6600 of our $8000 capital. I may need to look for one more smallish trade on a stock in the $14 range to take full advantage of our capital. If GME drops on Monday we could consider a far OTM play there, for instance.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR- I am going to double a small account, and you are going to watch.**

I will update this post as plays are made, and will create a new post each month as a recap. As always questions are welcome."

GME Reality and Fantasy Prediction,1609521660,caverypca,139,"  GME is going to have a BIG week.
Here is why:

- RC plays like a chess grandmaster 
- 2 large buys on 12/30 (one intraday and one AH)
- 1st buy came just before RCâ€™s tweets (mocking bears and warning that they are figuratively about to be burned alive in a house fire)
- Both large buys came in around the lows of the day
- QTR 4 in March will be a blowout
- Conference on Jan 8
- Probable release of holiday sales figures before conference
- Ridiculous % of shares sold short
- Hype on this stock is ratcheting up
- $600 stim checks are already in many of our accounts

How much more pain can the short sellers take? 

My crazy prediction/fantasy:

I think we go up 5% by 10 AM Monday,  Jan 4th. 

If a 13d comes out, we are looking at an immediate jump to $28 per share. From there, we go into a 3 day squeeze that will take us past $30 on day 1 (probably Tuesday Jan 5th by noon). On day 2 GME flys by $40, $50, $60, and momentarily hits $140 pps until it settles down around $80 pps by close on Day 3, which would be Thursday Jan 7th.

just on the same day. All were near the lows of the day.

RC felt antagonized. He already planned to buy shares, he did it yesterday, probably twice around $19 per share just on the same day. All were near the lows of the day.

RC felt antagonized. He already planned to buy shares, he did it yesterday, probably twice around $19 per share 
donâ€™t see it going down this coming week. Stimulus checks are out. The hype for this stock is ratcheting up. Plus, RC is making more veiled threats via Twitter and mocking the bears. 

RC is playing this like a Chess Grandmaster. Iâ€™m predicting another 13d to come out this Monday or Tuesday around 10/11ish AM.

Again, all of this is probably just wishful thinking. But, it may come true."

Iâ€™ve been doing quite a bit of research on Palantir. Thereâ€™s a few objectives for my research. 
1: To actually understand what it is.

2: To assess the long term growth potential.

3: To assess possible competition and how that could thwart market domination

Through all of this I became very excited initially. 

As this seems to be a free thinking pathway that can intermediate between pseudo â€œsubconsciousâ€ types of data relationships that would be unexplored by 99% of other data platforms.

Then I became quite terrified, really. 
This data is being used by central governments for the most part and huge corporations.

This is the medium between the value of data and the implications of everything that could be done with the amounts of data with no stone left unturned.

Not all of it will be good, that can be assured.

https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/about

From Covid tracking to ICE deportations. Palantir has data on otherwise low data groups with not much of a digital footprint.

The thing is that people like you and I, who have a massive data footprint will be most susceptible to the ways it uses data over the next few decades.

While Iâ€™m still working on 2 and 3. I think my first question came with more questions than answers.

Oh, and for those who fear the government might break it up, it wonâ€™t be regulated by the government.

The government will be regulated by PLTR.

TIF The New GME 2023 DD Inside,1609525432,usadeadpoo,5,"Here is my DD please be gentle.  2020 retards holed up at home.  Those lucky and unlucky enough to have a gf at home might have shagged a lot.  Maybe made a mistake, or a calculated YOLO bet on pulling out or whatever.  Maybe around Christmas or New Year's time.  9 months later in 2021 got lucky and dodged the bullet, but 2021 and 2022 we are still quarantined because this shit virus keeps mutating.

Come 2023 many babies born because boomer parents want grandkids before they go to the moon.  Need to buy diamond rings for the gf's diamond hands.  Profit off of GME and TSLA and then buy Tiffany sparkly ring for gf so that she leaves you alone when you lose tendies.  All loss forgiven when you buy Tiffany sparkly ring.

TIF as of today is at $131.45 been like this literally for months.  Limp like a limp bizkit but hasn't fallen off the cliff.  They are in litigation with Luis Vouton.  Gonna win.  Many autists buying rings and winning against Luis Vouton will bring this and your boomers to the moon.

TIF gonna go much higher than 135 WHUT ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  Join the train before Lebron retires in 2023.  Can't guarantee Tiffany wins against the Vouton by 2023 but many diamond rings purchased for sure bring the stock above 135 when it's $131 right now, right?"

Look over the list of stocks that have more than tripled in 2020 and GameStop has to jump out at you. GameStop? Really. The small-box video game retailer is one of this year's biggest winners despite wrapping up what will be its third consecutive fiscal year of declining sales. We're not buying physical games these days, and that's bad news for a model that relies on folks trading in their used games and gear for in-store credit.

We're kicking off a new console cycle, but hardware is always the lowest-margin business here. Once you score your PS5 you're not going to come back to GameStop for games the way you did in the past. GameStop used to be a cash-generating machine, but it's been three years since it turned an annual profit. The once beefy dividend was nixed two years ago.

A short squeeze has propped the stock higher, and the market's underestimating what a new console cycle will mean for GameStop. This game was over before it even started, and GameStop -- like DoorDash and SeaWorld -- will be a silent wealth killer in 2021.

QuantumScape [Real DD],1609531497,twenty94025,41,"**VW**

* **How did get tied up with QS?**
   * The VW CEO Martin Winterkorn son (also named Martin) works/worked for one of the QS Founder (Prof Prinz) at Stanford.
   * [http://npl-archive.stanford.edu/people/?m=134](http://npl-archive.stanford.edu/people/?m=134)
   * [http://npl-archive.stanford.edu/people/](http://npl-archive.stanford.edu/people/)
   * CEO Winterkorn resigned from VW (Dielgate) in  2015, but VW completed their first investment in QS in 2014 (and had a 'relationship' with QS since 2012 (according to the recent QS presentation))
* **Guess**: VW ""diesel-gate"" caused VW to bet bigger on clean-tech like QS, since they were already down the plan.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tech**

* **Prototype cell**:  Single-layer and 30 x 30 mm (1.1811 inch x 1.1811 inch)
   * The small size, which is quite far away from a commercial size cell makes be doubt if the results will scale to commercial size cells.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Lack of Energy Density Data**:  This is usually measured in Watt-hour/weight or Watt-hour/volume (Wh/kg or Wh/L).  QS shows a graph with their energy density at 1,000 Wh/L, but it wasn't backed up with any data, so it just looked like a goal.
   * Another point is that, when you have a 'solid' battery like QS, with no liquid electrolyte, you need  some additional materials to create the ionic conductivity between the anode and cathode (an anolyte and catholyte). No liquid electrolyte is good, since it reduces the ""explosivity"" of the battery.  But some in the industry think that, the need for an anolyte and catholyte, will cause the battery to have a lower energy density, and therefore not make economical sense.

&amp;#x200B;

*  **Solid State Separator (SSS**):  QS's main technical achievement is in the SSS, which separates the anode from the cathode.  Why hasn't anyone developed a good SSS yet?
   * **Perfect surface:**  The SSS needs to have perfect surface qualities.  If not, dendrites grow, and end up breaking through the SSS, and shorting out the anode and cathode (think of sticking a 2-prong fork into your electric outlet).
      * **Manufacturing Costs**: To create these perfect surfaces, requires technology more similar to semiconductor manufacturing than battery manufacturing equipment.  Semicon equipment is very expensive and doesn't have high-throughput (yes, when you're selling a &lt; 0.5"" square chip for $100+, it makes sense, but when you scale up to battery sizes, it doesn't make economical sense).
      * **Thin**: In order to keep energy density high the SSS needs to be thin, but the thinner it gets, the less strong it is.
      * **Fragile**: These thin and perfect SSS's are somewhat fragile, so in order to not degrade over the 100k mile life in a car, the battery pack needs to have more cushioning and other structures to make sure the SSS doesn't crack.   
      * **High Temperatures**:  SSS's conduct electricity best when they are warm 30C+.  This is why the main QS results are done at 30C and 45C.  Yes, QS shows some data at lower temperatures, but if QS's SSS worked well at lower temps, why weren't all the results shown at room temp (20F or 68F)?
      * Also needing equipment to warm up your batteries, takes up more battery-pack volume, therefore decreases the energy-density, and increase cost and complexity. 

Thank you for listening to my TED talk! I'm not a battery engineering, but I have been reading up a lot about batteries since the announcement of the SPAC and I hope you found this useful, please let me know if I have some wrong assumptions/ideas here."

PLTR's Foundry Managing Global Food Aid Distribution,1609531677,msg582,19,"It has been really great to see so many WSB members supporting their local food banks. So it gave me a great big philanthropic boner to see Palantir's Foundry platform beginning to manage The World Food Programme's global distribution network. 

[https://medium.com/world-food-programme-insight/coronavirus-world-food-programme-harnesses-data-and-tech-to-save-lives-c57c2b9e22ea](https://medium.com/world-food-programme-insight/coronavirus-world-food-programme-harnesses-data-and-tech-to-save-lives-c57c2b9e22ea)

 For those of you who can barely read the most important pull quote from the article is: ""Over time, Marketplace will expand to cover all WFP-provided services,  cargo transport by air, land and sea, storage, procurement, emergency  telecommunications, engineering support and more, facilitating response  to all emergencies beyond COVID-19."" The TDLR being that Foundry is positioned to grow into the backbone of UN humanitarian relief efforts going forward. 

Think about it, Palantir is helping deliver actual tendies all around the globe!"
If youâ€™re a retard that lost money this year you should read this,1609532119,Aordex96,69,"If you dumbass lost money last year. You can deduct your losses on your tax return. This loss is limited to $3,000 per year (single or married filing jointly)

If your wife has a boyfriend (married filing separately) then you can only write off $1500 per year

Now if youâ€™re a special type of retarded and you lost more than $100,000 you get to do tax write off for at least the next 34 years if not the rest of your life. Congratulations too you

TLDR: Youâ€™re getting a tax write off congratulations (money loss / ($3000 or $1500 if your wife has a boyfriend) and thatâ€™s how many years you get a write off for"

You guys like WFC?,1609535134,ChimiChangas2020,8,"Like this trade. But I think itâ€™s more of a shares play...long term hold where you donâ€™t want to pay theta. But my god I love this.

Shares play Bc overtime they will up div back to 3-4%. When that happens share price will be much higher 40-50. Buying shares now basically you are locking in a higher effective yield. 4% on 50 is 2 bucks every year. 2 bucks on original 30 dollar cost is 6.66% effective yield on your original share purchase. 

Thatâ€™s why I like this. Thereâ€™s a good chance you lock in 6-7% positive carry with even more upside for years, possibly decades. Dividend upping should happen in 2021 when fed allows banks to up dividend again...and div will keep growing."

How i ended up divorcing my wife because of WSB,1609535474,Lucky-Designer3469,78," From the time I was a child I dreamed my life would be a fairy tale - not a divorce story. I dreamed that I'd meet an amazing guy, find a great Job , and live happily ever after. But sometimes the path to that happy ending takes a few wicked turns along the way.

I thought the way to move ahead in life looked like this: do well in school, get into a great college, Understand Charts and Movements to day trade options, get married, have kids, and my reward for all of this would be to live with my love happily ever after. And it all started out that way...

I met my future wife shortly after I turned 19. she was a senior in the Chemical Engineering program and I was a freshman. To say we were smitten with each other is an understatement. i proposed 4 months after we met and she accepted without a second thought. 6 months later, we were hitched.

We moved a lot during the first few years, she never understood day trading more times then not bash me for not having a real job , and then we took a brake from society and went to sea . It took a toll on our marriage and we continued to grow apart over the years. As you can imagine, we were more roommates than spouses. We went to a marriage counselor, but it really didnâ€™t help. We wanted different things and no amount of compromise on either of our parts would allow us to deny the inevitable: Her biggest pet Peeve was the lack of a job . Of course day trading in general isnt a ""job"" but i made joblike figures . She wanted a man that was ""handy"" and ""manly"" not some ""bum"" like me. The amount of money i made day trading was decent . Made 20k sense the beginning of the pandemic . But she hated how it wasn't a real job , she wanted to see a ""real Job"" how im not no Average man , im a pussy.

I felt tremendously guilty because I took my vows seriously; to me forever meant forever and I had broken that promise. I couldnâ€™t sleep, my mind raced all night, and it led me down the path of anorexia. It was a very dark time for me.

But, luckily, I had friends and family who loved me and helped me see the light. Most of them had never been through divorce and didnâ€™t really know how to help me, but they were always there whenever I reached out to them. I also worked with a therapist and took a divorce recovery class. Both helped me tremendously as I slowly found my way back to the land of the living. I was a newly singled woman and the rest of my life was right in front of me waiting for me to jump in and play. I really could continue creating my happily ever after instead of my life end with a tragic tale of divorce."

Worse case scenario, you lose the same amount you owe on taxes from the free money and you write it off and break out even. Best case scenario, you get more free money. Which is what happened. I believe this is why the stock market went up so much."
$BBBY Short squeeze plan,1609536696,FrogoftheNorth,23,"Here is my take on $BBBY 6 days before their Q3 ER.

After a big change in management now led by Mark Tritton, $BBBY has managed to crawl back from the dead by shutting down numerous stores, selling the Cost Plus World Market and significantly improving the online shopping, which has played a large part in BBBY's success story.  All the company's debt has now been paid off and they have announced a large share buyback plan.

$BBBY managed to beat their Q2 estimate by $0,73 which resulted in $BBBY skyrocketing 70%. After that the stock has fallen 33% and has at the moment over 60% short float. 

All aforementioned information means that a large ðŸŒˆðŸ» trap has been set and we are going to see a massive short-squeeze. Q3 earnings are supposed to be positive and are going to function as a catalyst to brutalize the bears. Combining it with the January effect, $BBBY has set its course to the Moon and the engines have been fired up.

Possible risks:
-$BBBY fell through its support line at $18 per share. There is a large gap to fill and although unlikely, the fall to $15 is not impossible.
-According to Yahhoo Finance $BBBY has formed a bearish Top Triangle pattern. A bullish Falling Wedge pattern has also taken form in 1 day chart but in my opinion patterns won't play a large role in this short-squeeze.
-Average analyst rating is 2,6. Who really cares tho.

TLDR:
-Possible short-squeeze incoming
-60% short float
-Q3 ER in 6 days, likely to beat the estimated earnings
-$BBBY has fallen almost 20% during December, great time to buy.
-Buy shares not options.
-Medium risk - High reward"

stock has taken a hit since earnings where they beat both top and bottom line.  sure they did not give guidance but they have traditionally been conservative in forward performance.  couple of upgrades this past week as well and looks to have bottomed per the daily.

price hit a tested support level of roughly 258ish on 31Dec. this level was tested and held a couple of times since late Oct.

weeklies are cheap, sub 30 IV.  On verge of being oversold.

problem is i could see this stock going sideways for a bit, not much conviction out there... that i know of.  lacks a vol squeeze which i like to target.

*Processing img t99m4y35ys861...*

**PSTH is Bill Spackman's Baby Baby....**

It cannot fail. It has great financials with no debt and over $7B in free cash flow. Returns over the last 10 years have been higher than 20% each year. I have held this stock for over 10 years and the dividends are funny fun fun tendie time wowie.

The warrant structure ""TONTINE"" is fun for all the boys and girls.

***TONTINE: For every 9 common share you buy and hold through the merger you get an additional 1000 shares at $2.00! WOW! BIG SAVINGS.***

If a deal isn't struck, that is a-OKAY! You get free money! For every 9 shares that you own and if Ackman fails, you get $500 gift card for Herbalife Nutrition. Ha! Not gunna happen!

Its the greatest single company that ever did exist.

If you buy tomorrow at $29 you are getting in earlier.

This thing is going to $750 by mid-week next week.

Ackman has already announced a 200:1 stock split meaning the stock will trade from 750 to $3.75. That means a lot for you! You can buy it for 3 bucks! Great. Really bigly great.

If the mods don't pin this, that would be egregious!

Double your money! Buy PSTH!

GME careers as a reflection of their roadmap,1609545976,cxi-trader,41,"I always find interesting how companies' available jobs could hint at the future state of the execution of their roadmap. In the case of $gme you can find a few interesting things to observe:

\- eCommerce investments (keyword Omnichannel): [https://careers.gamestop.com/en-US/search?facetcategory=ecommerce](https://careers.gamestop.com/en-US/search?facetcategory=ecommerce) . Although it is in my opinion a very poor initial effort (only 2 job postings), it could be the start of the effort to hire the core leadership team first.

\- Technology: [https://careers.gamestop.com/en-US/search?facetcategory=information%20technology%2Fecommerce%20technology](https://careers.gamestop.com/en-US/search?facetcategory=information%20technology%2Fecommerce%20technology) . As can be seen here (also only 2 job postings).

It is clear that $gme lacks the engineering caliber to execute RC's vision and the board; as of today, is not quite showing that they are taking the necessary steps to pursue reinventing the business. Looking forward to the upcoming events and announcements in 2021 Q1 and Q2.

Potential in coming real estate dip in 2021. Are there any non-idiots among us that work in this space and want to share their thoughts?,1609547783,myNameIsPDT,158,"TLDR: I have no fucking clue what I am talking about. It looks like the housing market is ready to decline in late 2021, maybe as soon as the spring. I am considering selling my rental house soon... obviously so I can yolo more into GME, PLTR, and SPCE - I can't help myself and I don't want help. If this happens, REITs might dip further, making for a nice entry point.

&amp;#x200B;

Home prices have been steadily rising the last five or so years to the point  we are seeing a spike in the inflation adjusted housing costs. It looks  like we are at the 07/08 highs again.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r6on75066t861.png?width=739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bac32713ff598bab5431b52ae7d8e45332340ba

I have been following the forbearance rates since covid started, and it looks like many of the national lenders have forbearance rates in the 3-6% range, still.  Historically these are under 1% for all lenders. If these eventually  turn into delinquencies after the forbearance period expires and covid  eviction protections expire, I am worried we might see a surge in  foreclosures and thus a flood of cheap real estate hitting the market, thus drastically reducing home prices in the second half of 2021.

I'll  walk you through the timing I am seeing. 

* The majority of forbearance  requests were made in March - June (the MBA has been publishing this  data). 
* These periods usually last 180 days,  based on historical forbearance periods. 
* And I believe these periods can  be extended for up to one year, which is also part of covid relief.
* The  national average number of delinquent payments on a mortgage before  foreclosure is about four.
* For those with 180 day forbearance periods started in March- June of 2020, it looks like this: 6 months forbearance + 4 months delinquency = 10 months, which puts these foreclosures on the market in February 2021-May 2021.
* For those with 365 day forbearance periods started in March- June of 2020, it looks like this: 12 months forbearance + 4 months delinquency = 16 months, which puts these foreclosures on the market in July 2021- October 2021.
* Finally, for those who were delinquent prior to covid, and would have been evicted during covid, the eviction protection has prevented banks from foreclosing, so these homes will hit the market in February 2021, after the eviction protections expire on January 31st 2021. Foreclosures are down 80% this year because of this.

&amp;#x200B;

If  we check FRED and look at delinquent payment on real estate over the  last 20 years, we can see about 10% of homes and real estate were in delinquency by 2010 (below). If all the current forbearances turn into  delinquent payments, which turn into foreclosures, we could see a 2-6%  spike by the end of the summer, or a 2-6x increase in foreclosure  based real estate hitting the market. Plus we need to add in the 80% of foreclosures that will hit post eviction moratorium. That would be about 2/3s the delinquency rate we saw post financial crisis, which would could cause quite a dip in home prices.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 5rr035o96t861...*

The current market is also further magnified buy the shortage of homes for sale, in part due to the lack of foreclosures due to the eviction moratorium. You can see below, the US is at an all time low for monthly supply  of houses, dating back to 1960.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4136uv3c6t861.png?width=1174&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=859c31a721b63b5c01f787d6cfec5ae387a8700e

When you combine a low supply with a relatively high demand (see housing  sales the last two years, below), this creates a pretty expensive market based  on supply and demand. Also, interest rates are low, so people can afford more, so housing prices are higher as a result.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/abfzz0he6t861.png?width=1179&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd698a8aefca84c6318c3c74da02ec2293b7aa19

In agreement with this, home prices are the highest in history as well  (below), even when adjusted for inflation (first figure of the post).

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img nhdsp7bh6t861...*

&amp;#x200B;

This could easily turn  into a serious situation in which a sudden spike in foreclosures and  cheap real estate could cascade into a pretty swift crash, and  significantly reduce the value of real estate around the country by a  huge margin.

Does  anyone here have any real expertise on this matter? I am a complete  newb and idiot. I don't know what I am doing, I am just speculating. I  would greatly appreciate an expert's opinion on the matter.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*I do want to clarify that some of the timing of iOS 14 changes could get changed and Facebook could push back against certain parts of the change. I did my best to explain the basics of what I think is going on, but it is possible that I miscommunicated or misunderstood some parts of the iOS 14 update, so digital marketers, feel free to let me know in the comments and I'll edit accordingly\*\*\*

\-------------------------------

# TL;DR - Apple's iOS 14 - ""Get Zucked, Zuckerberg,"" Said Tim Cook

For reasons that will be explained below, it is possible that Google and Facebook will begin seeing their duopoly slowly diminish over the next several years (probably &gt;7 years, based on how ""fast"" Turtle Mitch is able to get anything done). I do believe that Google and Facebook will continue to be the top two players in the game for the foreseeable future **(SO I AM NOT RECOMMENDING SHORTING THESE AT ALL YOU ðŸŒˆ NOOBS).** 

The core problems that these companies will soon face, especially Facebook, is [anti-trust law suits from the FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization), more distrust of their platform due to the most recent election, censorship across both platforms, a complete failure of Facebook to properly address the negative side effects of social media on the youth and actually do something about it, and, most importantly, **Apple upgrading to iOS 14 (explained more later).** 

* [The Anti-Trust Law Suit from the FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization) talks about Facebook becoming a monopoly and buying all the competition such as Instagram and WhatsApp, instead of competing against them.
* [iOS 14](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2020/08/30/ios-14-facebooks-apple-nightmare-keeps-getting-worse/?sh=3029be574cfe) update will roll out early 2021. This will hinder the collection of iPhone identifiers for advertisers ([IDFA](https://www.appsflyer.com/mobile-attribution-glossary/idfa/)), one of the primary things used to track users online.

\-------------------------------

Primary Issues For Facebook From The iOS 14 Update

1. &gt;!Bidding Issues:!&lt; As I stated above, Facebook is going to lose more and more data points as  time goes on, making it so that they aren't able to bid appropriately on someone like Johnny Bravo when he is scrolling through his insta feed. What does this mean? Insta may look at Johnny Bravo as a Joe Schmo and decide that he's not worth bidding up on, so Johnny Bravo will never see those ads of Playboy and Whey Protein that he would have bought if he got an ad for it. (Example for this: with the iOS14 update, Facebook loses its data points to Johnny Bravo's workout apps, so they had no way of knowing he would have been more likely to convert.
2. &gt;!Creating Audiences:!&lt;Facebook is going to lose thousands of data points on its users, effectively making it harder to match these audiences into their appropriate buckets. Before, if someone had several golf apps on their phone, you could assume they were a golf lover more easily. Without being able to use that app data sharing, it will be much harder to know they like golf unless they follow several golfing pros / shows in Facebook.

\-------------------------------

With the expectation that Facebook will become less efficient as time goes on and that certain lawsuits could negatively affect the company, many advertisers are looking for other viable options to put their ad dollars. There have been several social media competitors working to monetize their app and become the third wheel of digital marketing. Some of these companies include:  


* PINS - Pinterest ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
* SNAP - Snapchat ðŸš€
* TWTR - Twitter ðŸš€
* Twitch - (Owned by Amazon aka AMZN) ðŸš€ðŸš€
* LNKD - LinkedIn (Owned by Microsoft aka MSFT) ðŸš€
* Hulu Ads - (Owned by Disney aka DIS) ðŸš€ðŸš€
* TikTok - Not sure if correct, but you may be able to get shares [here](https://www.ig.com/en/shares/ipos/bytedance-tiktok-ipo) (ticker tbd, but pretty sure it will be ZOOMR ðŸš€

The name of the game is trying figuring out which of these new channels will be the next to gain 5-10% more market share of ad spend from clients and which will be nothing more than moneyless pits since they do a terrible job at monetizing their app and creating engaging ads that lead to conversions for clients (looking at you SNAP and TikTok).

\-------------------------------

MY RECENT BACKGROUND (aka why should you even bother listening to this autist):

* **Worked in digital marketing and finance for the last 5 years**, also took on several side jobs doing digital marketing for companies
   * **I managed &gt;$10 million in ad spend across various digital marketing channels (Google/Bing/Facebook/Shopping) over the last 30 days** and over &gt;$40 million in ad spend over the last year
   * I work with a team of Managers and Directors at my agency to help talk about new opportunities and keep up with digital marketing trends across all channels
   * Using our &gt;300 clients data, our company is able to look at macro trends at a faster rate, so we can quickly identify which new channels to focus our efforts in (Pinterest/TikTok/Snap/Twitch/etc.)
      * This was highlighted over the last year or year and a half when we noticed a huge spike in companies using Pinterest as a primary channel for digital marketing. Only more and more companies are going to join into the race, this is just the beginning.

\-------------------------------

# Any of these stocks or multiple could improve throughout the following years, but my money is on PINS ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

* Even with PINS recent run up in stock price, I think there is still plenty of time to buy this stock now.
   *  Our clients are continuing to spend more and more on the Pinterest ad platform and it is returning better performance metrics (ROAS/ROI) than most of the other mentioned channels. 
* Pinterest also relies on on targeting people based on boards they visit/follow/create, combined with using a search query method for ads, somewhat similar to Google's. **This means they don't have to rely as much on pixel data, like Facebook does, to create their audience targeting.**

&amp;#x200B;

# I think the safest way to make money on PINS is to buy stocks for the long term, but I know that doesn't get some of your little schlongs hard enough. 

* Their next earnings are on 2/4/21(after hours) and ***I fully expect them to smash expectations just like McConnell's dad smashed that turtle to give birth to Mitch.*** 
   * Look at PINS options that make sense to you for a little after earnings, preferably not 2/5, literally the day after earnings. But you do you boo.

In fact, every single award returns a 100% loss, while Reddit laughs their asses off for getting you autists to buy into their dopamine fueled trap. Science doesnâ€™t lie bitch, and if you actually spend money on these awards you simply hate money (or are retarded), thereâ€™s no other way to put it.

Donâ€™t tell me I didnâ€™t warn you, besides, itâ€™s much more fun to lose money options trading anyways. 


TLDR
Reddit â€œawardsâ€ are useless pixels and a (proven) waste of money, instead buy GME shares/calls, BBBY shares/calls, THCðŸ shares, NIO shares/calls, and buy the PLTR dip.

GME Gang GameStop.com 4Q20 Model Update,1609552826,Uberkikz11,160,"Happy New Year once again GME Gang! 

Okay, since you know that I'm obsessed and literally Can't Stop, Won't Stop, GameStop! ... Here's a 4Q20 model update to kick off 2021 as we start to gather up our popcorn for the ICR Conference festivities in just 10 days ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kknuk6/gme\_icr\_conference\_words\_matter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kknuk6/gme_icr_conference_words_matter/))

For those that have big brains and have been following along (here's the most recent one: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kh9na8/gme\_4q20\_financial\_model/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kh9na8/gme_4q20_financial_model/)), I have ticked almost every metric down, with the largest reduction being a 4k+ trim to daily order rate as January/post Christmas has started off rather weak. It's irrefutable that supply, whether through managerial operational failings, or lost market share, or outside their control due to Covid, is weighing on sales. Whenever there's been console supply especially the uptick in sales is notable and somewhat durable in the order rate data (many thanks once again GME Gang for the steady influx of [GameStop.com](https://GameStop.com) order #s!!!

With two full months of the quarter gone by I would note no one should have ever put their belief solely into one quarter making/breaking their thesis in isolation (unless you're talking about a biotech or some crazy shit. But this is a goddamn [GameStop.com](https://GameStop.com), FKA GameStop, we're talking about here.). The bears will vociferously argue otherwise.

My base case sits at $2/share, and will likely come down a touch more barring incremental console supply in January (in base case).

I think WSB is sleeping on a huge opportunity in Apple this month. Hereâ€™s why.,1609553867,WBuffettJr,300,"**TLDR:** Due to a confluence of factors (none of which are technical analysis), I believe a perfect storm is likely forming for a monster, historic ER occurring sometime in late January. The initial main factor for this was that COVID issues were causing a delay in the iPhone 12 launch, pushing it into to this quarter, but that led me to discover numerous other factors now making up my thesis. I believe not only will earnings grow, but the multiple could even expand. How to play it: calls dated end of Jan or mid Feb.    
    
# Analysis:    
Happy hangover day, fellow autists. I believe opportunities are rare to know when an ER is going to blow it out of the water by enough to overcome IV crush based on more than just a hunch, and when they occur once or twice per year you should swing big. When I play earnings releases, Iâ€™m almost always just a seller of spreads so that I can profit off of theta/IV crush surrounding the ER (theta gang always wins). This time however, Iâ€™ve bought outright calls. Here is what Iâ€™m seeing with Apple: 
    
## The iPhone 12 delay could mean huge YoY comparisons.    
What kicked all this off was that two months ago I realized we could be heading for huge numbers this quarter do to an atypical delay in the launch of the newest iPhone. Typically new iPhones are announced in mid-September with preorders beginning immediately and shipments beginning before the end of the month. However this year because of COIVD delays the launch date got pushed into October. The iPhone 12 preorders began mid-October with shipments a week later, and the iPhone 12 mini and Max began preorders November 6. And that means no sales of the new models counted in the quarter ended Sept. 30 (Appleâ€™s fiscal fourth quarter)as they usually do. This year all of those opening day sales have fallen into the upcoming fiscal Q1, setting up a potentially huge quarter in sales and making for easy YoY comparisons right out of the gate.  [Hereâ€™s a Fortune article on the delay of the launch.](https://fortune.com/2020/10/29/apple-q4-2020-earnings-delayed-iphone-12-sales/)    
    
## The â€œsuper cycleâ€ rumors appear to be true.    
As a lover of new tech, I always have to remind myself that the average person doesnâ€™t care about incremental new features as much as I do. So when I heard rumors earlier this year that Apple could be facing a â€œsuper cycleâ€ of upgrades due to 5G, I was skeptical. How much does the average person really care about spotty 5G service enough to jump on a new iPhone? But based on reports starting to come out, those rumors appear to be correct. Iâ€™ve seen a few articles suggesting a super cycle not seen since the iPhone 6.     
    
[Hereâ€™s a Yahoo Finance article on Wedbushâ€™s analysis](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wedbush-apple-aapl-iphone-12-141113883.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACvsQ8XuWl-EktMyc_0BOQkervx-N2812THmBzr26X8EZIBpNv2lmQ5FSlcToQD1EVRPC0q6byIRBL57FjX5kL4yCvJbv0rwaj4D16cz9J0QrnLFX9fVib7fRoDktDyMAWwBKhfTL_JRqy04wsJCzfTUD7Aw9ce6SkM21ZQOqbYO).   
    
Here are some notable quotes from that article since I know we donâ€™t read around here.    
&gt;""Based on our recent Asia checks we believe the supply chain is anticipating low to mid 90 million iPhone unit builds â€¦ **a roughly 35% increase from our original and Street forecasts**,"" says Ives, who covers AAPL stock for Wedbush.    
    
&gt;Compare that to the firm's expectations for iPhone 12 unit sales over time. Three months ago, Wedbush expected 65 million to 70 million unit builds for the December quarter; it raised its outlook to 75 million units in late October; and in mid-December, it set a ""stretch goal"" in the mid-80 million range.    
    
&gt;Wall Street broadly sees AAPL selling 217 million iPhones in the company's fiscal 2021, but Wedbush's bull case is ""north of 240 million units (250 million could be in the cards â€“ an eye popping figure)"" that would easily surpass the 231 million units the company sold in its fiscal 2015.    
    
&gt;**""We have not seen a launch uptrend such as this in a number of years for Apple and the only iPhone trajectory similar would be the iPhone 6 in 2014 based on our analysis.""**.   
    
[Here is an AppleInsider article, although it quotes the same research at Wedbush](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/15/apple-iphone-production-reports-corroborate-supercycle-thesis-analyst-says).   
Notable quote:    
&gt; That bump in production would represent a 30% year-over-year increase in smartphone models produced, **and is also well ahead of current Wall Street expectations**, Ives wrote.    
    
    
Itâ€™s anecdotal, but I personally skipped the iPhone 11 upgrade because I was perfectly content with my XS Max, however I did buy the 12 Pro Max.    
    
## The iPhone 12 sales mix:   
Itâ€™s not just that phone sales will be up on the iphone 12 launch, itâ€™s the mix within those sales. Typically when Apple launches phones they sell more of the of the entry level new phones than they do the premium, because the total addressable market is bigger. That doesnâ€™t appear to be the case this time. As early as September people were reporting that [Apple was making more higher end iPhone 12 models than entry-level handsets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-gets-price-target-hike-iphone-12-sales-mix) anticipating a shift in demand, and they appear to have been correct. Last year the entry level iPhone 11s outsold the premium iPhone 11s by a three to one margin. This year almost immediately after launch [people were reporting that the premium iPhone 12s were selling as much as the entry models.](https://investorplace.com/2020/10/greater-than-expected-iphone-12-demand-apple-aapl-stock-buy/) Since then, there have been reports trickling out that the premium iPhone 12s appear to actually be outselling the entry level versions.   
    
## Apple sold out of nearly everything they make for Christmas.
See further below for one of the reasons this may have happened, in both my â€œmacroâ€ and â€œrisksâ€ sections.    
    
    

Apple introduced a slough of new products from iMacs to watches this year, and they sold out of all of them. **The list of sold-out products at Christmas included the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max; iPad, iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad Mini; MacBook Air and Pro; iMac and iMac Pro; HomePod mini, and AirPods Max.** [Hereâ€™s a Barronâ€™s article mentioning the sell outs](https://www.barrons.com/articles/barrons-10-best-stocks-for-2021-51608337138).    

    
    
Apple wearables, I would argue, are now what economists call Veblen goods. These are unique products where the demand curve actually increases as the price increases. This can happen in goods such as wine, where the consumer lacks the knowledge in how to evaluate the product so they take pricing as a signal of quality. But another reason you can get that skewed demand curve is if the product conveys status. One example of this is sports cars. You can buy cars with 90% of the performance of the ultra top end cars for 30% of the price, but thatâ€™s not the point of owning them, is it? How often are you really out at the track? Lambo isnâ€™t in competition with $50k sports cars. They could raise the price $50k per car and people who can afford them would just want them more. Louis Vuitton bags and $50,000 Birkin purses are more examples. In fact with Birkin they not only constantly raise prices, they forbid people from buying them. You have to spend a lot of money on other lower tier products before youâ€™re â€œallowedâ€ to even buy a Birkin bag. This just makes new money women want them even more. 
   

Those are dramatic examples of course and Apple isnâ€™t behaving that way, but Apple just introduced very overpriced, new over-the-ear headphones which cost almost twice as much as the leading competitor, and yet...Apple sold out of every single color in the first two weeks and hit a three month waiting list by Christmas on a product that I would assume due to its high pricing has very fat margins. Apple charging twice as much makes them more appealing, not less, because wearables are worn and thus seen by your peers (and the opposite sex).   
    
## The Twitter rumor mill is reporting parts moving at a brisk pace
I canâ€™t track down the things Iâ€™ve read here and there on Twitter and Iâ€™m starting to run out of steam here, so you may have to do some searching on your own, but people who usually track movement of parts through the companies forming Appleâ€™s supply chain and normally have a good track record with their reports have reported that parts are moving through the chain at a very brisk pace. This is addressed some in the reports on the iPhone supply chain in my earlier links.    
    
## App sales are crushing it.   
Thanks probably in part to quarantine, app sales have been crushing it and [grew ~35% this December compared to ~17%](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/apple-alphabet-strong-christmas-sales) the prior year, meaning sales have grown at twice the pace.     

## Reoccurring revenue bundle numbers will be announced     
The biggest thing Iâ€™ve learned from 2020 is that nothing matters more to the market than the narrative surrounding the reoccurring revenue bundle...aka subscriptions. A company announces its cutting its dividend, but then tells you thatâ€™s because its going to pour all that money into boosting its subscriptions? The stock skyrockets. Look at Disney. AT&amp;T may be able to pull this off as well if it can convince people of that narrative with Warner/HBO max and cut its dividend to pour it into content, but thatâ€™s a big â€œifâ€ for them.    
    
Apple launched their new reoccurring revenue bundle this year. I personally signed up for the premium tier and now owe Apple $30 per month for the rest of my life. I was already paying them to backup my phone to the cloud, and now their bundle has thrown me into Apple Music, Apple TV+, etc. I am firmly entrenched in the Apple universe whether I like it or not.     
    
It is these reoccurring revenue numbers that offer the possibility of earnings multiple expansion.
    
# RISKS
**Are sellouts due to high demand, or due to COVID-related production problems?**    
I donâ€™t know.  Based on the reports Iâ€™ve read, some of which have been linked earlier in my post, it sounds like everything is running full speed in China and the supply chain is running at near or above a record clip. One possible risk is that this was not the case earlier this year and thus Apple sold out of things because they hadnâ€™t produced enough heading into Christmas. I personally believe that production may have taken a huge hit early in the calendar year, but by mid to late 2020 this was no longer a significant issue. I also believe that even if sales have taken a slight hit due to production, the market wouldnâ€™t really care. Markets are forward looking. They know COVID has impacted things globally, and even if Apple reports sales difficulties **they will be paired with significantly increased guidance for Q2**. [New reports have suggested that Apple has had to increase its iPhone production plans for 2021 by 20-30% because of strong demand}.(https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/15/strong-iphone-12-demand/) An announcement like that is not a recipe for a stock crash.     
    
    

**Macro factors causing a crash**.    
A lot of people around here appear to be scared of an impending crash. This seems to be based on the simple idea that stocks have run up a lot and therefore must crash. A reversion to the mean is imminent. I donâ€™t see it that way and I think the economy is more complex than that. Just because something has gone up a lot does not mean itâ€™s going to crash. People have been warning of a California real estate crash for 70 years.    
    

Iâ€™m a little bit older than you guys (by probably about 10-15 years) and I can remember the market frenzy of the dot.com boom. A lot of people were saying the same thing then, and while they were ultimately proven right, they were very early. I remember seeing another year to year and a half of enormous gains after hearing all those warnings. Of course the problem with musical chairs is that we never know when the music will stop, but I would argue if anything stocks are roughly fairly valued, not dangerously overvalued.    
    
As we go into 2021, we face the following conditions: a vaccine roll out that sometime between now and late â€˜21 will lead us into a v-shaped recovery. [The Krugman argument for this vision](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/opinion/joe-biden-economy.html), and [The Bloomberg argument for this vision](https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/opinion/articles/2020-12-01/get-ready-for-a-supercharged-economy). We also just had the Fed reaffirm 0% interest rates and the continuation of QE. Add to all of that very easy YoY earnings comps for the first two quarters of this year and this is not a recipe for a crash, itâ€™s a recipe for a steady market melt up. Where are the rich supposed to put all their money in a 0% interest rate environment? 0% pushes up the value of all asset classes, and this is especially true of real estate and stonks. Generally speaking, predicting macro economic movements is a losing game, but all of those things combined with the easy YoY comps means I donâ€™t feel the need to be concerned of an impending correction for at least the next two quarters. 
    
A much smaller factor but still a factor, I have seen it suggested that Apple will be among the larger beneficiaries of the stimulus checks going out, although those have not started rolling out until just now so that may have an impact on Q2 if any.

**Bad subscription numbers**    

If subscriptions to Apple One flopped, this could significantly overshadow sales and earnings numbers. I personally feel Apple isnâ€™t likely to seriously miscalculate predictions on a subscription bundle because they have their market dialed in, but I donâ€™t know that for sure. 

**Sales could have cratered in October**    

Sales often drop a little in the weeks preceding a phone launch. What if phone sales tanked during the delays waiting for an iPhone 12? That could be bad. Iâ€™m encouraged by the fact that iPhone 11 models appeared to still be having good sales numbers when the iPhone 12 was launched (see links earlier in this post), but I donâ€™t really know what October sales look like.

**COVID could have tanked all phone sales.**    

[This report says all phone activations generally tanked 23% on Christmas Day.](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/apple-iphones-dominate-christmas-day-activations) Two thoughts I have on that, that number is for all phone activations, not just iPhones. And two, thatâ€™s just for Christmas Day itself. There could be a wide array of reasons activations were down on that one day. To counter that, [this report says the iPhone was the best selling 5G phone](https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/21/best-selling-5g-phone/), even in October despite the phone not launching until the second half of that month. Additionally that article mentions pent up demand for 5G apple phones that sales are likely to be strong going forward.

##  Technical Analysis   
I donâ€™t believe in technical analysis. Charts donâ€™t know any of the things I just explained, and are therefore, in my opinion, useless to me. Maybe somebody has figured out a system for charts to predict the future, but I am not that person. 

## Fun rumors    
Iâ€™m not big on speculative rumors and momentum type plays, but if thatâ€™s your thing there are certainly rumors in the air. The most famous of which is the rumor that Apple is back to working seriously on an EV Car. Another is reports are just coming out in the last day or two that [Apple is seeing new successes in developing foldable tech.](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/31/two-foldable-iphones-reportedly-pass-tests/) Whether these things will impact the stock price isnâ€™t really my cup of tea, but if itâ€™s yours those are two things to consider. 

## Is my post an attempt at a WSB pump and dump?    
Iâ€™m under no allusions that my own WSB post is going to alter the trajectory of a $2.25 trillion company in any meaningful way.  That sort of thing may work on a post-IPO company that hasnâ€™t had its lockup expiration yet and thus has a tiny float (aka PLTR or numerous other recent â€œto the moonâ€ meme stocks) with limited float. (Thatâ€™s not to say those arenâ€™t great companies or great trades. Iâ€™m just sayinâ€™).


## My positions: 
Iâ€™m more conservative than most of WSB.  While I love this place with all my heart and love you guys for it, I believe risking it all to chase screenshot-worthy gains is moronic and not the path to building real, long-term wealth. Thus my positions are probably more conservative than youâ€™d expect.    
    
I have 20% of my net worth tied up in Apple via LEAPs. 9/16/2022 APPL $87.50 calls. I consider this to be essentially stock I hold for the long term. Delta is approaching 1 anyway so they practically are stock. Sometime in the depths of March I loaded up on FAANG LEAPs with the intention of actually holding them for years and then converting to shares. Those LEAPs were a little OTM at the time I bought them. I have no interest in day trading my significant LEAP positions so thatâ€™s going to sit there for the next two years.

But I also have put an additional 15% of my net worth into short term calls on Apple to play the ER. I have Feb 19 $130 calls which were about 10-15% OTM at the time I bought them. They are currently ITM. I also have 1/29 $135s and 1/29 $141s.     
    
This puts 35% of my net worth into Apple.

## How to get rich
I intend to cash out my short term calls after the ER, and I donâ€™t intend to reinvest or roll them out because I suspect Apple will be fully valued by then and there are better plays out there. I intend to keep my LEAPS because I bought those for the very long term and because at the very least I should hold them until March to hit the long term capital gains tax rate.    
    
I intend to take my profits from the calls and push them into shorting NNOX and XPEV, both of which have significant lockup expirations coming in mid to late February which I believe will significantly impact the stock prices in the short term. I have no interest in shorting XPEV right now, because you guys are crazy as fuck and for all I know EV stonks could all run up another 50% in the next month. Right about the time the Apple ER hits should be perfect.

## Criticism    
If you think Iâ€™m wrong, I would strongly encourage you to comment. I donâ€™t give a fuck about looking correct or saving face but I give many fucks about not losing money. If Iâ€™m wrong, I want to know it. 

## The Most Important Factor

I haven't heard many retards on here pumping it so trying to see what the consensus is in WSB land. Tilman is a fucking stud and with SPAC's, betting on the Jockey is priority.

"Broke Short-Seller: ""Tesla is no longer â€œa growth storyâ€â€”itâ€™s a nearly-profitless stock promotion for idiots!""",1609557465,JasonColin,33," [https://www.valuewalk.com/teslas-figure-for-q4-deliveries-isnt-production-constrained/](https://www.valuewalk.com/teslas-figure-for-q4-deliveries-isnt-production-constrained/)

&gt;1. Tesla has no â€œmoatâ€ of any kind; i.e., nothing meaningfully proprietary in terms of electric car technology, while existing automakersâ€”*unlike* TeslaÂ­â€”have a decades-long â€œexperience moatâ€ of knowing how to mass-produce, distribute and service high-quality cars consistently and profitably, as well as the ability to subsidize losses on electric cars with profits from their conventional cars.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. Excluding sunsetting emission credit sales and adjusted for its fraudulently low warranty reserve (see below), in 2020 Tesla will again lose money, as it has every year in its 17-year existence.  
&gt;  
&gt;3. Unit demand for Teslaâ€™s cars is only increasing via continual price cutting.  
&gt;  
&gt;4. [Elon Musk is a pathological liar who under the terms of his SEC settlement cannot deny having committed securities fraud](https://www.plainsite.org/realitycheck/tsla.pdf).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; **Nothing is more amusing than seeing this giant stock promotion of a company try to perpetuate the illusion of being â€œsupply constrainedâ€ by continuing to add capacity (expanding its Chinese factory while breaking ground on new factories in Texas and Germany) in order to desperately try to maintain an image of â€œlimitless demandâ€ while it continually slashes prices just to utilize far less than its existing capacity. Teslaâ€™s â€œplanâ€ is now obvious: keep slashing prices to move as much volume as possible while using the worldâ€™s most illicitly creative accounting to maintain razor-thin profitability. But whatâ€™s the end game? If Tesla stops cutting prices volume will collapse. Tesla is no longer â€œa growth storyâ€â€”itâ€™s a nearly-profitless stock promotion for idiots!** 

Wooo, that's one man man who lost probably hundreds of thousands to millions betting against the inflated stock market supported by the printer, powell, and Tesla S&amp;P inclusion hype (before it got in).

He should have invested in literal Tesla shorts, and sold them back on the online market, he would have at least be in the green with some profit lol.

I mean, I suppose he's correct about the bubble, but the injections aren't going to end until around 2022 when the zero% interest rate suddenly improves for banks, bonds, and such, so sadly for him the riding keeps tiding! Those ""idiots"" he speaks of, like it or not, made 100x more money than most people in the market, including people on this sub!"

Something to feed your confirmation bias on Nio,1609560777,not_kathrine,97,"Nio's expansion to Europe has been discussed a lot. Many expressed doubts that Europeans would buy a Chinese car given all the negative stereotypes. From 2021, Germany introduced a CO2 tax (7c per liter) and till 2025 they give 9000 Euros for purchasing a EV. My main problem with German EVs is that they have an abysmal range. VW promises something up to 220km. I drove BMW i3 and whatever they promise there, the truth is that it's around 170 km and the charging takes like 9 hours. Why the hell do I need a car with such a range? 

Nio offers a range up to 900 km. Wow. That's something to consider. But what about the Chinese quality and as a potential German customer who got screwed over by the government's CO2 tax right on the New Year's day I decided to google what German reviews say on Nio:

ADAC praises Nio quality and price, specifying that 70% of materials are from renowned producers like Bosch

https://www.adac.de/rund-ums-fahrzeug/autokatalog/marken-modelle/auto/nio-es6/

Another very positive review stating that it has some problems with being adjusted to the European standards and market but in general it's a good car for German roads and is much cheaper than a comparable Audi

https://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/fahrbericht/nio-es6-guenstiger-elektro-suv/

Another generally positive review. They point out that the battery is not suitable for a speed of over 120km/h which is a big problem for Germany's autobahn as 120 km/h is the annoying grandma speed here. However, other European countries have a speed limit so it might be less of a problem

https://www.autobild.de/artikel/nio-es6-performance-2022-test-preis-deutschland-reichweite-technische-daten-elekrtro-suv-17098037.html

Tl;dr German reviewers praise Nio for its price, quality and driving experience. The main disadvantage is that it is not fulfilling for some Europe-specific demands. However, if Nio adapts to those requirements, it will be a recommendable car.

Tl;dr for retards: Nio at the European market ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€"

Bill Ackman's $5-7 billion SPAC

**May 14, 2018** \- SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell stated in a TED Talk that she expects the constellation to cost at least $10 billion.

**Oct 15, 2019** \-  â€œInternational Telecommunication Union (ITU) confirmed  it had received filings from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on behalf of SpaceX to request spectrum arrangement for 30,000 Starlink satellites on top of the 12,000 satellites for which SpaceX had already filed with the agency.â€

â€œAs demand escalates for fast, reliable internet around the world, especially for those where connectivity is non-existent, too expensive or unreliable, SpaceX is taking steps to responsibly scale Starlinkâ€™s total network capacity and data density to meet the growth in usersâ€™ anticipated needs,â€

**Feb 6, 2020** \- SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell told investors on Thursday at a private event hosted by JPMorgan Chase in Miami:

â€œStarlink is the right kind of businessâ€¦ we are likely to spin out and go public.â€

â€œThat particular piece is an element of the business that we are likely to spin out and go public.â€

â€œWeâ€™re thinking about that zero,â€ he said. â€œWe need to make the thing work. â€¦ Itâ€™s real important to just set the stage here for LEO communications constellations. Guess how many LEO constellations didnâ€™t go bankrupt? Zero.â€

â€œIf we donâ€™t improve our pace of progress, Iâ€™m definitely going to be dead before we go to Mars,â€ 

â€œI would like to not be dead by the time we go to Mars. Thatâ€™s my aspiration here.â€

**Dec 17, 2020** \- Bill Ackman follows SpaceX on Twitter (For enthusiast of Yolo style DD)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/PSTH/comments/ke2jrx/bills\_just\_trying\_to\_troll\_us\_now/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSTH/comments/ke2jrx/bills_just_trying_to_troll_us_now/) 

**Analysis:**

In 2018 Musky needs $10 billion to complete Starlink's global constellation. By 2019 SpaceX had filed for 42,000 satellites but are accused of trying â€œto drown the ITU in studies so they can go ahead and operate Starlink under FCC sharing rules while ignoring the ITU first to file rulesâ€ ([https://twitter.com/TMFAssociates/status/1183436364974419968](https://twitter.com/TMFAssociates/status/1183436364974419968)) At this point I believe that funding methods were being discussed and the possibility of a Starlink spin off was proposed. 

February 6, SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell expresses this sentiment at the JP Morgan event. I think it was still only speculative and Musk would basically refute this March 9 at the Satellite 2020 conference saying he was thinking about it â€œzeroâ€. In August SpaceX reported raising $1.9 billion in private funding. This plus funding series J though M equals around $3.2 billion.([https://craft.co/spacex/funding-rounds](https://craft.co/spacex/funding-rounds)) 

By the end of September Musk tweeted ""We will probably IPO Starlink, but only several years in the future when revenue growth is smooth &amp; predictableâ€ and that â€œIâ€™m a huge fan of small retail investors. Will make sure they get top priority. You can hold me to it.""

Did something occur between March and September that changed zero to probably? Bill Ackmanâ€™s SPAC Pershing Square Tontine Holdings (PSTH) IPOs July 22. A blank check company with $5-7 billion to spend, specific acquisition requirements, and marketed as â€œthe most investor friendly SPAC in the world.â€ Despite no announced target, there are substantial investments by Guggenheim, Baupost, Soroban, etc. ([https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=PSTH&amp;subView=institutional](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=PSTH&amp;subView=institutional))

In October, Momentus announced it will go public through a reverse merger with Stable Road. Their partnership with SpaceX and backing by Prime Movers Lab establishes a tenuous connection between Musk and Ackman as well as aligning interests.

In December, after reports that SpaceX was seeking funding to double its valuation to $92 billion, Musk coyly responds â€œIncorrect.â€ The following day u/Mobiledead posts a screenshot of Bill Ackman following SpaceX on Twitter. 

When I read the PSTH=SpaceX speculation I wrote it off as being as likely as Subway or Pornhub. But when I looked into the timeline of the various threads, there were some stars that seemed to align for Starlink. Bill Ackman was offering the right amount to help complete Starlinkâ€™s constellation. The $5-7 billion could fit the 10-20% minority share he intended to acquire with the SPAC depending on how much of SpaceX's valuation is derived from Starlink. Ackman would take the largest SPAC to date and bring internet connection to the entire world cementing his legacy as an investor and an activist. Musk would be able to stop funneling money from his true passion with SpaceX, the Mars mission. And most importantly even small retail investors would see astronomical returns. 

The main argument against Starlink, in my opinion, is Muskâ€™s prediction of an IPO several years in the future and his tweet cautioning investors about SPACs. ([https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1329483695493931009](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1329483695493931009)) My counterargument: He says a lot of shit on Twitter. Although Starlink does not fit every acquisition criteria, we know Ackman was in talks with AirBnB at one point and they are missing some of the acquisition criteria as well. I don't think that Starlink is the most likely candidate for PSTH but I no longer think that it is entirely impossible. This is purely speculation and I'm sure there are things I've missed. If there's something I'm misunderstanding feel free to correct me.

**ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS MORE â€œARTIFICALâ€ THAN â€œINTELLIGENTâ€**

As has been dutifully noted by many fellow autists, Palantir is an artificial intelligence/algorithim data mangement software company. However, you donâ€™t quite have to worry about your wife going off and getting a robot boyfriend anytime soon. While this may come to a surprise to Jeffery Epsteinâ€™s pal Steve Hawking[who believed robots will soon take over the world](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newsweek.com/stephen-hawking-named-epstein-unsealed-files-virginia-giuffre-ghislaine-maxwell-1521920%3famp=1)  smart people in the field have been dealing with solving the problems of making artificial intelligence work for decades. This is good news for all those that have diamond hands ðŸ’ŽðŸ‘ on their Palantir shares in the coming years, because one of the founders solved one of the major problems over a decade ago and Iâ€™ll tell you how.


**The problem with Artificial Intelligence and the Palantir Solution**


If you arenâ€™t yet familiar with [Stephen Cohen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Cohen_(entrepreneur)) you should be. This is the ultimate autist chad that coded the first prototype of Palantir in 8 weeks. At his time at Stanford, he studied machine learning and artifical intelligence (this was way back in 2005, these beasts of nature are always 20~ years ahead of the normie media and their trends). However, as Cohen himself mentions in his talk at Stanford [â€œThe Path to Palantirâ€](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g_6_kGDdjwI) he became dissapointed studying AI due to the many limitations of the field he quickly realized. Firstly, the AI is only ever as smart as the algorithms that the humans were able to develop, thus more â€œartificialâ€ than â€œintelligent.â€ Secondly, while computers are able to store and calculate numbers even faster than an autist doing his math homework before his mom will let him have his tendies, and their superior skill at storing this information, computers cannot grasp numerous concepts that humanâ€™s are skilled at. Most fundamentally, this is creativity and anything that is subjective. The example Cohen uses in his speech is hunger. Try explaining the feeling of hunger to someone and while you may be able to quantify it as a number between 1-10, this quantification leaves a lot out that someone that has never experienced hunger would understand. To put it simply, there are numerous factors in life that are impossible for a computer to qualify. Computers are good at factors they can quantify (numbers) but are as retarded as your average WSB bottom feeder when it comes to the qualitative (subjective). This is where Palantir comes in. Effectively, Palantir solves the quantitative issues for the human and lays it out for humans to interact with and add in qualitative analysis. Palantir is a marriage between a computerâ€™s impeccable ability to process and store numbers and data and humans impeccable ability to use creativity and view context as well as the subjective. 


**Software &amp; Business: The Dinosaur Superstructure**


Heres where our other founder bellwether [Peter Thiel ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel) comes in. If you havenâ€™t heard of him yet, your girlfriend probably doesnâ€™t you stay out past 8 PM, even when sheâ€™s not home. Member of the paypal mafia, when hes not busy making billions with his buddies musk and bezos, heâ€™s [taking down Gawker with Hulk Hogan ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/06/21/peter-thiels-war-on-gawker-a-timeline/?sh=78387f3251c5)for outing his private sex life. Like how Cohenknows how computerâ€™s work, Thiel knows how businesses work. How many people here have been in an actual office building? Probably not the right crowd, I know, most of you still live in your parentâ€™s basement, but that wonâ€™t matter when PLTR moons. Anyway, one of the first things youll notice is that the majority of technology used by businesses and governments are older than the average /r/teenagers poster. [According to research conducted by Kaspersky, â€œfour in ten of very small businesses (VSB), and roughly half of small and medium-sized businesses (SMB), still rely on operating systems such as Windows XP or Windows 7 which are nearing their end of life.â€](https://www.itproportal.com/amp/news/businesses-still-dependent-on-outdated-software/) For some reason, I cannot find similar statistics for even larger companies that would be more likely for Palantir to be working with, but iâ€™d wager from experience and knowing the scaleability issues that come with updating to technology, especially when dealing with a bunch of boomers, that it would be even higher for large companies. However, this is great news, because our good friend Thiel has the perfect formula to grab the biggest 6000 businesses by the balls.


Essentially, Palantir fronts the costs of installing and getting the software embedded into an operation in itâ€™s â€œacquisition contractâ€ stage. Im not a finance frog, but from what I understand they donâ€™t actually make money from these contracts. Hence why they havenâ€™t been profitable. However, the model is like a snowball. After the acquisition contract has expired, the boomers running the operation Palantir is contracting to have finally figured out how to use the software without training wheels and it is entrenched in their companies business. A larger contract with higher margins is signed. Further, companies of that companies competition look at what Palantir has done for that company, such as when in Q3 Palantir found 315m in unnecessary spending for an oil and gas company, slotting to save the company 1b in the coming 12 months https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx and they are forced to sign an acquisition contract, further pushing the snowball along and acting as a case study of success for Palantir. 


Remember to diamond hands and buy that dip. The markets are an unmedicated bipolar teenaged girl on her period and currently Palantir is in a downswing, but that is only a buying opportunity for the wise of us. Short term, I could see Palantir dipping as low as $20. This negative feedback loop will be broken either by a new contract, Karp interview day, another media announcement, or demo day. Eventually. Iâ€™ll lose a lot of you here, if I already havent, but hold strong and donâ€™t stress the short term as long as you agree with my thesis and have done/seen enough due diligence of your own to understand the fundamentals of this company are as solid as Karpâ€™s skiing legs. Longer term, I can see this company being at 100b+ market cap being conservative.

Is Moderna currently undervalued?,1609572119,RexSueciae,29,"Let me start out by saying that whenever someone like the Motley Fool puts out an article about why this stock or that stock is a sure thing / is not recommended / is a dumpster fire, I have the urge to do the opposite of their recommendations out of sheer spite. And, indeed, those guys put out an [article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/22/why-moderna-stock-plunged-today/) wondering why MRNA took a dive about a week ago. No firm conclusions from them, other than the fact that Moderna isn't on their list of the top ten best stocks which might have been drawn up by a haruspex for all I know.

Anyways.

I'm serious when I say that I think Moderna is undervalued. And I don't have any financial interests in this post, either. Mostly I'm trying to psych myself up because, hey, maybe I'm not talking nonsense. Their stock price just looks absolutely bonkers.

Everyone who bought Moderna at its peak a month ago has been keeping up with the news. No doubt most of you have been watching red numbers in horror. (I'm sure there's at least one bear who's sitting nicely on some puts, but I don't know how many people put their money down on what would've been a very risky wager. It can't be zero.) Moderna got its emergency use authorization from the FDA awhile back; they're not the only company with a COVID vaccine, though, and the headlines for Moderna since then have been pretty bad (in comparison with, say, Pfizer). Many vaccines have side effects, but then you hear about the fact that [side effects with the Moderna vaccine are super common for people with dermal implants](https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/moderna-vaccine-facial-filler), and every now and then you'll see an article about [some frontline worker getting hospitalized after their Moderna-powered vaccination](https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2020/12/moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-triggers-severe-allergic-reaction-in-wallowa-county-health-care-worker-officials-say.html) (there's more than one example, that's just the most recent). And the investors are panicking.

Investors, of course, are stupid sheep, because this stuff is nothing new. Remember back in 1976 when [an outbreak of the swine flu caused the Ford administration to push through a vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_swine_flu_outbreak), then some people who got the vaccine ended up with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, ironically causing people to freak out even more? You know how many people actually suffered serious side effects? A few hundred. Out of literally millions -- about 25% of the US population, including President Ford himself, received the vaccine. What happened was basically the worst-case scenario and the chances of any single person getting their nervous system mangled was still infinitesimal. You'd literally have a better chance of being struck by lightning. (Lightning, for what it's worth, doesn't usually kill, either.)

Yeah, maybe people who have had cosmetic surgery recently should be careful with the Moderna vaccine. That's nothing. Most people will need to wait their turn anyways, as healthcare workers will largely continue to get the first doses. I don't know if the majority of Americans will have a chance at vaccination before the end of the coming year. For every scaremongering news article reporting on (relatively uncommon) side effects, you get a bunch of other articles about how, say, [Moderna's vaccine was just used to vaccinate a senior living facility](https://katv.com/news/local/moderna-vaccine-administered-at-little-rock-senior-living-facility). (I have no idea about the ratio -- can't be bothered to do the math -- but you should also keep in the mind the old adage of ""if it bleeds, it leads."") Hell, the biggest risk associated with Moderna's vaccine is probably wastage from negligence or malice, [like what happened with that pharmacist in Wisconsin](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/31/952536531/pharmacist-arrested-accused-of-destroying-more-than-500-moderna-vaccine-doses). Dude straight-up destroyed 550 doses. Big yikes, as the kids say.

I feel like if I don't watch myself I'll veer off into a tangent about vaccine safety in general and other fun topics that're suited for a good ramble. The main point is this: Moderna's still putting out vaccines. They finished Phase 3 trials very, very recently. The verdict? [It works](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/moderna-announces-publication-results-pivotal-142200437.html). If you get COVID you could get seriously fucked up, as the poor souls in the placebo group cofirmed, and the people in the vaccine group all lived. Oh, yeah, and the Department of Defense is buying up doses under some cushy government contract. That probably means something.

Maybe it's just my gut that says a company which has put out a viable COVID vaccine shouldn't have its stock continue to tank indefinitely. The trend line of MRNA prices has been steadily [down since early December](https://i.imgur.com/xSLwIJM.png). In the last few days, though, I think I see the barest [hint of an inflection point](https://i.imgur.com/8tb2XQp.png). In the [past day, even](https://i.imgur.com/z2fIQT1.png).

Or maybe I'm seeing things and it'll continue to slide. If you think that I'm wrong, go ahead and take out a whole bunch of puts, see if you're not too late to pull in a profit. I don't care. I just hope fewer people will be dying from COVID from now on.

I have been a bull in the RV market for a long time. I first bought nio at 1.60 per share. However, I currently believe that Tesla stock is extremely overpriced.

Looking 10 years in to the future, I believe Tesla is going to dominate Ev market. Their future revenue are going to be diversified and stable. The problems is the stock price  today is based on earnings from 2030. That means the stock price is going to be around the same level as today 10 years from now. I donâ€™t t believe investors will be willing to hold on to an  investment thatâ€™s high risk for little reward. 

The second the ev fewer slows down, the stock will have a massive correction and recover at a rate that match earnings. 

The way I am looking at Tesla is as if everyone in 2000 knew apple will pass two trillion in market cap by 2018.  Of course every one will buy in until apple reach a valuation of 2 trillion. However, people who bought at 2 trillion arenâ€™t going to hold for 20 years for 40% gain. There would be a massive sell off. The same thing is going to happen to Tesla. The people who bought at peak price arenâ€™t going to hold for 10 years just for the price to the share to be justified.

The Dummy's guide to trading the Georgia Senate Runoff,1609578399,dragom7,137,"**TLDR: If you are pretty sure about what the trajectory of the Georgia Senate Runoffs will be, you can make money. Scroll to the bottom for the plays (for each outcome)**

**Introduction:**  
Almost everyone on this sub knows QQQ. Now, recall the price action around Nov. 3 (or if you can't because you're that guy from the movie Memento, pull out your Robinhood app and follow along with me kid).  

On the eve of the general election, when the so-called pollsters said it would be a Democratic sweep, QQQ sat at $269. The next day, with the election contested, QQQ rocketed to $294. It remained steady on Friday, before declining the next week.  

Why did the election affect the price the way that it did? Well, it's because Biden's legislative agenda depends on Democratic control of Congress. In particular, he can raise corporate taxes with just a simple majority in the Senate.  

The institutional whales (the folks who actually move markets) believe that:
- Companies that benefitted bigly from Trump's tax cuts (tech companies especially) will be hurt by Biden raising taxes.
- Companies that would benefit from fiscal stimulus (green new deal, infrastructure) will be helped by by Biden's plans, and even more if Biden controls Congress.  
- Regardless of who controls the Senate, the divided nature means some companies are guaranteed to benefit.

Don't take my word for it. Read this report from Goldman Sachs (p.15-16): https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/beyond-2020-post-election-policies-f/report.pdf   

Originally, tech companies (facing more regulation and tax increases under the Democratic Trifecta) was trending down. But then, when it became clear the Republicans would hold the Senate and taxes weren't going up, tech stocks soared. Yet, suddenly, there was a small blip downward the next week. Why? Because David Perdue (R) was headed to a runoff, injecting the possibility that Democrats still had a chance to control Congress.  

**Which stocks are impacted, and why**

If Democrats gain control of the U.S. Senate, that means Biden can pass his legislation.
- Some companies will be helped bigly (e.g. Renewables)
- Some companies may be hurt (more taxes) but also helped (more fiscal spending)
- Some companies may be hurt bigly (more taxes, regs, and less gov't subsidies)


To make this a pure election-related play, we want to trade:
- companies that benefit bigly from Democratic legislation (and don't have short-term non-political risk)
- companies that are hurt bigly from Democratic legislation (and don't have short-term non-political risk)

So what companies benefitted the most from Trump's tax cuts? (Source: Goldman Sachs Client note)  
- Tech companies like Netflix, which saw its effective tax rate go from 23% to 7%.
- Railroad companies like CSX, which saw its effective tax rate go from 37% to 23%.
- Healthcare companies like HCA, which saw its effective tax rate go from 32% to 20%.
- Pure financial companies like CME, saw its effective tax rate go from 36% to 23%.

Obviously, pandemic-related questions muddle price-action on healthcare. At the same time, there is still some policy uncertainty to what will happen to railroads regardless of the outcome of the runoffs (they will have higher taxes, but that may be offset by stimulus/infrastructure spending). That leaves two sectors as our pure election plays:
- Tech companies will get more regulation and higher taxes if Biden takes Senate
- Financials will get more regulation and higher taxes if Biden takes Senate

Out of those sectors, specific companies may be overvalued or undervalued, and other concerns may matter more than legislative impact by the U.S Congress. For example, BABA is a tech company in QQQ, but as a Chinese company it sure isn't going to impacted much by U.S. tax legislation. We can just ignore it.

However, a U.S. company like NFLX which is a bit overpriced and very exposed to a tax-cut rollback, is an excellent bear trade for a Democratic Senate scenario (especially if corporate tax increases start being mentioned). While MSFT, which is slightly under-valued and also exposed to tax increases, may be a good trade against a Democratic Senate.  


Information about the races to consider:
- In the November General election:
	- Perdue (R) won 49.7 percent of the vote, while Ossoff (D) won 47.9 percent. In other words, Ossoff substantially underperformed Biden.
	- The Republican candidates (Loeffer + Collins) won a combined 49.4 percent, while the Democratic candidates (Warnock et al) won a combined 48.4 percent.
	- These are both substantial leads for the Republicans.
- The ""reputable"" polls:
	- Republican-leaning Trafalgar Group (""most accurate pollster of 2016""), which had Trump up 3-4% in its November poll (i.e. 3-4% wrong), has now pegged both the Democratic candidates leading slightly in its late December poll.
	- Democratic-leaning Survey-USA (which has pretty accurate polling) had Biden up 1-2% in its last general election poll, is now predicting a Democratic sweep in its late December poll
	- Poll to Watch: AJC/UGA, with polling by UGA Professor Trey Hood (the most accurate major poll this year for Georgia). This will be released soon.
- The Rev. Raphael Warnock is currently in divorce proceedings, and was recently accused by his wife of running over her foot with his car. Watch for whether this gains any traction (or at least enough to sway swing voters)


The plays:
- If you expect both Democratic Senate candidates to sweep (both 2%+), then AGGRESSIVELY short QQQ, NFLX, CME, and long green energy + industrials (e.g. etfs like TAN and Solar stocks like ENPH). I would buy weekly Jan. 8 FD puts.
- If you expect both Democratic Senate candidates to win with a significant margin (both 0.5%+), short QQQ, NFLX, CME. I would buy puts for Jan. 15/22, since the counting might drag on a few days.
- If you expect Republicans to comfortably hold at least one seat, long QQQ (specifically NFLX, FB, and MSFT) for Jan. 15
- If you expect Republicans to sweep, long QQQ and short green energy for Jan. 15.
- If you expect it to be unclear whether Republicans can hold at least one seat (think month-long recount), long vega on QQQ &amp; NFLX with a bearish tilt. This would be a short vertical call spread, or buying a medium-term strangle. 
- If you expect Trump to still be President on Jan 22 following the events of Jan. 6, aggressively short SPY and long MAGA because a civil war is probably coming."

Just letting you know the bullshit behind clean energy: be long on big oil,1609582690,bragghy,189,"*DISCALIMER: If you want to learn about this in more depth and want to verify my claims, this is a link of a TED conference from a seasoned enviromentalist who explains these issues in details (*[*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-yALPEpV4w*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-yALPEpV4w)*), but for the purpose of wsb, I will keep this post nice and short and focus on what really matters: money. Also english is not my native language, so forgive any errors*

In the last few years there's been a lot of speculation around the shift to renewables. A lot of people are bullish on solar, wind an EVs and are very bearish on big oil companies. I'm going to explain to you why **the government(s) shift to ""clean energy"" and the recent oil crisis  is actually very bullish for big oil in the medium to long term**.

# Renewables cannot exist without oil

Basically as it turns out, **current tech for solar and wind sucks big time**, and it probably will for decades to come. Not only they are nowhere near as enviromentally sustainable as nuclear power (because they need lots of terrain,  use 20x more resources than nuclear fission power plants, and there are recycling issues), but most importantly, these green plants depend on the sun shining and the wind blowing, so **they can only run and produce energy about 30% of the time.** The key here is that there is no real efficient way (no, pumping and dumping water is not efficient) to have these plants running without coupling them with fossil fuel burning regular plants, beacuse otherwise the electric power grid would be a mess. **So the real reason that all these oil companies are fine with the government shifting to green energy is that, to run this utopia of solar panels, wind turbines, and EVs, you'll still need their oil**. In fact, these companies are the ones that are lobbying politicians (in particular democrats, in the US case), persuading it to pursue this ""green"" bullshit instead of going with real less harmful choice, which is regular old nuclear energy. 

# The 2020 oil price shock benefits BIG oil companies in the long run

The oil price disaster in march might cause a short term problem with oil companies, but **BIG oil companies rubbed their hands**. Maybe the small oil companies or the ones with lots of debt can face problems and go out of business, but **the GIANT with a healthy balance sheet can survive the crisis and have even more market share**. You have to think about this as if oil companies were coffee shops. During corona, many closed and never opened again becaus eof bankrupcty, so the ones that had lots of cash available before the big hit, the big players like Starbucks, will benefit when there is full or partail reopening of the economy.

# Oil demand will not shrink that much

If people knew that **oil is not just used for powering engines**, they probably wouldn't have such a negative outlook on oil demand. Guys, oil is fucking used to build anything that is made out of **plastic**. Even to make some **medications** you need stuff that comes from oil. To get all the useless shit that the west buys from India and China, you'll still need oil to power **container ships** that sail the ocean. Once this corona shit is over, people will still buy plane tickets to go on vacation. Sure, maybe business trips will take a permanent hit and there be slightly less demand due to the transition to ""green"", BUT, as we said earlier, green still needs it .... and we are still not adressing the elephant in the room: there are massive **emerging markets economies** growing in the worild today, a lot of second and third world countries that will still rely on oil for their initial growth for decades. These countries will offset the loss of demand from developed nations. Shit, general commodities prices have been skyrocketing recently. You wanna jump on steel gang and not on oil gang? The only way oil prices fall from here is if OPEC shits the bed.

# The play

As long as this obsession for and complete ignorance and denial on how to solve climate change continues, and as long as the goverments of the west are corrupt and cannot see that they need to boost nuclear power and public transportation instead of solar, wind and EVs, big oil companies with a heathy balance sheet will be fine in the next decade. **Many oil companies are trading at or below book value, with massive dividend yields**, it won't stay like this forever. Do yourself a favour and be long on **RDS, XOM, BP, TOT, CVX and maybe even the italian E**. Saw a lot of hedge funds buying **OXY** in the past few months for some reason. Either buy shares, and if you are a brave man use leverage. I wouldn't advise options on this one since we don't know when the catalyst for the rally will come, and one of the main points of the play is to get that juicy dividend. If you just need to use options, use LEAPS for the love of god. I expect a return of AT LEAST 20% on teh shares alone, maybe even a lot more.

**TLDR: shift to solar and wind will actually benefit supermassive oil companies with healthy balance sheets that can weather the current crisis**"

GME Price Targets for 2021 ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ (According to the Short Float Data) ðŸš€,1609587670,ShortTheNasdaq,263,"ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ GME GANG CHECKING IN. ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ 

Dear GME gang ðŸš€,

I wanted to share my Price Targets (PT) for GME but no BS here. I give you my PT according to actual facts.

Letâ€™s take a look at the table and check when the short % of free float went from a high point (\~160%) at around February 2020 to a low point (\~140%) - which by the way are in absolute terms both huge numbers.

*Processing img zojf6rxwnw861...*

The stock went up \~94% **BUT** most of the gain took place at 2 key moments: at the recovery of the market crash and then in late August which shows that ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ-ing is key to capture most of the gains. Why do I say this? Because when holding the stock you could â€œfeelâ€ like you bled when you watch the stats:

*Positive daily returns:          49.3%*  
*Negative daily returns:         50.7%*

BUT IT WAS IN FACT THE SHORT SELLERS WHO BLED HARD. CHECK THIS OUT:

*Best daily return:                   23.0 %*  
*Worst daily return:                -13.7 %*

Imagine you sold GME when the -13.7% happened. You would not have captured the 94% returns. So just ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ and let those shorts go bankrupt.

Okay, here I showed **FACTS**. Stuff that actually happened. Here is **my opinion about a reasonable price target** now according to the data.

I think we could **easily** hit +80% returns over the next 6 months when the short % of free float will return to 140% it makes **a lower bound PT of $34 without a short-squeeze**. But this doesnâ€™t even account for the fact that some short positions could not be able to hold from here. Keep in mind that some short-sellers have a triple-digit drawdown already.

# Conclusion

**Price targets for the 6-12 next months according to the data from 2019-2020** :

* Conservative:  $34 without a short-squeeze (+80%) 
* Likely to happen: $50 without a short-squeeze (+180%)
* Optimist:  $70 without a short-squeeze (+372%)

Note that these are price targets if the short % of free float go down to \~140% the price could go up substantially more. AND I didnâ€™t even account for the fact that Ryan Cohenâ€™s stake is now at 12.9%. 

I will be honest here, with a short-squeeze I have actually no idea where this could go but again very easily $100.

**I WILL PUBLISH THE ULTIMATE DD ON GME TOMORROW BE SURE TO CHECK THIS OUT (NO BS IN HERE).**

**Positions**: a lot of shares."

I cant really read or do actual dd so I decided to do my own retarded evaluation by spending dat $600 stimulus check at a gamestop store today to get my own in person evaluation and let me tell you it was amazing!

It's been a rainy boring dystopia lately and this morning I saw my stimulus check hitting my account.  I've always wanted a Nintendo switch so I could play zelda and Mario games again so naturally I drove to the nearest Gamestop to immediately spend all of my money.  

Upon arrival i saw a sign on the door stating that they had a new trade in system and they would buy any games or gaming system from you (I have an old PS4 I  use to play while my girlfriend was away hanging out with her other guy friends).  I asked the employee what they would give for a PS4 and he told me they would give me 100 dollars cash or 150 dollars in store credit!  The old gamestop probably would have given me 5 bucks and a stick of gum but the new one gamestop is looking out for you.

I bought my switch and the games and signed up for a pro account because someone on here told me to do that and I follow you guys blindly because I'm stupid.

All in all it was a lovely experience and when the next quarter reports are disclosed note that 450 dollars of there earnings are from my stimmy money!

Gamestop is a bad idea,1609593702,Cato022,14,"Common guys wake up GME was a bad investment the company has no future. I mean they sell PHYSICAL video games, wich you often can get much cheaper on G2A or other keysellers, the thing that is mainly still keeping them afloat are the pop! figurines and the merch but not everyone is buying their merchandise and therefore its the lesser part of their profit. Many prefer just to play the games, wich you also can buy online cheaper and also there are games you can just buy online,so there is not really a future for them something that manifests in their willingness, to sell you subscriptions. The company might retain their business in some places but will probably decline and so will the share price. They also have an overall bad reputation in the gaming community from badly refurbished consoles, to aggressive subscription selling to screwing over the customer. They just sell mainly triple A titles that  you can get cheaper on the internet. They need to maintain their stores wich a keyseller must not and they are vulnerable to  covid lockdowns. So do yourselves a favor and sell the shares at the next time they go up. And if you look for something where you will get much money from buy Games Workshop shares because they have a functional online store a business model and a fan community that will buy whatever overpriced stuff they put out, they also have a product that just they can sell and according to their shareholder conference big expansion plans."

1. Huge EV+ risk that is largely uncorrelated to market risk (short squeeze).  Even low probability of outcome makes more effort and capital worth it.  Piling on the trade actually increases its likelihood.
2. Fundamentals and activist investor (Cohen) give, at minimum, a plausible semi-bluff on turnaround.  May make errors but error will not be Blockbuster one.
3. Chart technicals are incredible.  5x move but still largely invisible except to /wsb.  1.35B market cap gives face validity to 10x return even with move that already happened.   
4. Perception of silliness and dismissal around threat have made short sellers prone to errors and more likely to pay off big.

For poker folks, it reminds me of holding a big flush draw.    It may not come through, but the possibility allows us to bet aggressively and potentially take the pot even without the hand.  If it hits, we can potentially entice our opponent to pay off big later.   Plus our opponent doesn't take us seriously, increasing their chance of overvaluing their ability to bluff us out."

Solar spot discussion and what does it mean for the financial market?

As we all know, the sun controls our lives and financial markets. Recently we have passed the halfway point of the solar activity trough. Because of this, I am predicating that SPY will reach 430 dollars by the end of 2021, as we leave the bearish cycle of the sun and enter the hyper sunshin bullrun. These are fundamentals, since the sun is a fundamental indication of our financials. -- yes I am not a fucking notradomeass for predicting stocks go up. Also made username in 2019.

CRSR DD - Discounted stock! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€,1609604946,Age_Specialist,91,"Hi fellow retards and autists,

It is time to quit lurking and give you a DD of my own: CRSR - Corsair Gaming, Inc.

This will be a long read, but fear not I will post a TL;DR section at the end.

Lets start off with something more trivial, but important nonetheless.

1) Management: Maybe you do not know the site â€œOwlerâ€ but one of itâ€™s features is that members of the website can rank CEOs. Andrew Paul (Corsairâ€™s CEO) has a rating of 92/100. Apart from Andrew the team consists of people believing in the brand and having proven to be successful. Read up on them https://www.corsair.com/us/en/team


2) Market sentiment: It seems people have generally gotten scared last couple of days and letting their hands turn into paper. If you have any position in CRSR, keep it. If not itâ€™s a great time to buy. Although it would seem there is a bearish sentiment on the stock there actually isnâ€™t. Thanks to /u/maxfort86 for making a handy tool for checking options (seems to be down though at the moment) we can see there are actually a lot more call options than puts telling us the sentiment is bullish. Apart from options we can also turn to the general analyst price target on finance.yahoo being a $40,11. It also enjoys a Zacks rank of 1 - Strong buy.
Heck even /u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT became a millionaire with the stock and loaded back in 5 days ago and although some people think he dumped, Iâ€™m pretty sure heâ€™s going to ride it with me to a PT of $55-$60 unless it rockets hard and well than weâ€™ll just strap in for more %.
So even if it follows conservative analysts you can make over 10% in a pretty short term without actually making full on retarded plays.


3) Earnings date: They crushed their last earning report and nothing tells us the next one is going to be different. It is estimated that they will report earnings feb 09, 2021. The moment they will report their earnings you know this sucker is gonna soar. They almost doubled their previous consesus EPS and the way things are going I believe they will beat it again easily since the next consesus EPS is still lower then the realised one for Q3 and as I said nothing really changed or will change by then. Corona still got a lot of people at home and more and more people are buying equipment for pcs and also breaking them through more (sometimes abusive) usage. More sales = more profit = stonk go up.


4) Confirmation bias: Who doesnâ€™t love hearing they are right? Well everything is screaming that CRSR is going to make moves, yes it is discounted now and heck maybe itâ€™ll discount a little further a maximum of 10%, but the reward surely outweighs the risk on this one. Everyone is saying this is a must buy and will rise back sooner than later. Just look at finance.yahoo or zacks like I mentioned or any other of the gazilion sites that exist. None of them are saying this stock isnâ€™t going to go up, the contrary is very much true in this case.


Disclaimer: I am not a professional or financial adviser, if you want to buy the stock because of the DD it is at your own risk. These are my convictions not a sure prediction of the market.


Positions: 488 stocks @ 37,39, donâ€™t dabble in options.


TL;DR; buy stonk, make money. Hold longer, make more money ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€"

# **Politics will be front and center as a catalyst in the first week of the new year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/politics-will-be-front-and-center-as-a-catalyst-in-the-first-week-of-the-new-year-.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind, but already in the dawn of the new year, the market could face its first big challenge.
*****
&gt; The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday, when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.
*****
&gt; With President-elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate.
*****
&gt; The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats. But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win, each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.
*****
&gt; â€œGeorgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years,â€ said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. â€œItâ€™s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.â€
*****
&gt; Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff, while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.
*****
&gt; â€œItâ€™s a binary event,â€ said Mills, adding itâ€™s of growing interest to markets. â€œThe general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent, the 2018 election has humbled us â€¦ The Senate outcomes, in particular, seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.â€
*****
&gt; Mills said the results may take several days to determine, adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey, 88% expect Republicans to maintain control, and most say that is a positive for the stock market.
*****
&gt; â€œThe market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats,â€ said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.
*****
&gt; â€œThat totally dominates [trading] because itâ€™s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes,â€ Boockvar said. â€œI think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spendingâ€ by Democrats.
*****
&gt; # By the numbers
&gt; A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks, as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&amp;P 500 was up 16.3% for the year, ending at 3,756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year, followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year, and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12,888.
*****
&gt; Besides the runoff vote, the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week, including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100,000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245,000 jobs created in November.
*****
&gt; There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday, and a number of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.
*****
&gt; The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.
*****
&gt; Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed, and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow, and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trumpâ€™s task force.
*****
&gt; In that recent RBC survey, three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. â€œWe suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met,â€ RBC strategists wrote.
*****
&gt; They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.
*****
&gt; â€œThis suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point, it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night, closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery,â€ the strategists noted.
*****
&gt; Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Bidenâ€™s presidency.
*****
&gt; However, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley says he will challenge the certification, and several House Republicans have already vowed to contest the election at that time. If one House member and a senator jointly object to a stateâ€™s slate of electors, the two houses of Congress must separately debate and vote on the objection.
*****
&gt; Strategists see little chance of any impact on the election outcome, but there could be fireworks. Trump has been claiming since the election that there was fraud but multiple courts failed to find any truth to the claims.
*****
&gt; Rupkey said investors are not taking into account enough potential for political risk from the deep animosity between the two political parties.
*****
&gt; â€œI think the additional stimulus and hopes for additional stimulus, and infrastructure spending in 2021, I donâ€™t know that that is such a slam dunk, because of the issue of political instability,â€ he said.

&gt; # Why A Year-End Rally Bodes Well For 2021

&gt; Welcome to the last day of 2020! It has been a devastating year in so many ways, yet for investors it has been quite rewarding. Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far, the best end to a year since WWII.

&gt; A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. â€œTurns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&amp;P 500 the following year every single time since World War II,â€ explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. â€œIn fact, January was also higher every single time as well, so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.â€

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile, January was up 5 for 5 as well, rising an impressive 3% on average.

&gt; Hereâ€™s what the average year looks like after the prior year gains 10% or more the final two months compared to a typical year. Once again, strong returns are the playbook historically.

&gt; # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days

&gt; In a year with some pretty crazy charts, the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year, bot the S&amp;P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right, with just a few hours left in the trading year, the S&amp;P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%, while Long Term US Treasuries, as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd, the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**

&gt; The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time, the S&amp;P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year, but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978, there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.

&gt; # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology

&gt; With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990, the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then, not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years, but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days, they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!

&gt; In terms of cumulative returns, the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018, whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years, while the S&amp;P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore, since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**

&gt; Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years, there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018, AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain, but that's because Apple (AAPL), the sector's largest stock, has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.

&gt; On the downside, just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value, while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly, FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%, so depending on how it acts in the next two days, it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.

&gt; # Growth Dragging on Small Caps

&gt; In the past couple of weeks, we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically, taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps, with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocksâ€”proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)â€”are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th, IWO surpassed the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance, and even after pulling back in the past week, IWO is still in the lead.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**

&gt; As a result of recent moves, there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below, we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**

&gt; As to just how sharp of a reversal this was, in the five days through yesterday's close, the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that, April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months, but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring, the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011, 2008, and a handful of times in the early 2000s.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**

&gt; Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks, small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market. While there was a bit of a turn lower in recent days, it has been nowhere close to as dramatic of a move as growth stocks.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large4.png))**

&gt; In the charts below, we show average performance over the past week of Russell 2000 stocks broken into deciles based on their price to sales and price to book ratios. As shown, the most aggressively valued deciles have averaged the worst performance in the past week. Stocks with low P/S and P/B ratios have not been immune from the weakness, but they have held up significantly better.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading year ahead r/wallstreetbets."
Christmas gift for all my degenerates!,1609605930,ClosetPsychopath,14,"*Long time lurker, first time poster*

This â€œpredictionâ€ is for overstock (OSTK). 
Overstock is currently trading at a strong resistance level as well as itâ€™s 200 day SMA, and well below its 10, 20, 50 and 100 day SMAs.  All these make a bounce likely this week. 

Now if you look at the 2hr chart for OSTK, you will notice that on that chart it is also trading well below its major SMAs. For the past 3 months, the price has been trending down moving sinusoidally, with the high prices bouncing off the 200SMA and low prices bottoming out at roughly 80% 200SMA. 
OSTK is currently trading at ~-2 standard deviations below its 50SMA and when looking at the MACD relative to price between 12/29 and 12/31, there is a divergence. These 3 factors lead me to believe a price reversal is eminent.

Moral of this post, OSTK is trading at $48 right now. The 200SMA (2hr chart) is $61. I predict over the next month (and probably sooner) OSTK will go back up to ~$60. 

Opinions of this analysis is greatly appreciated. 

Happy hunting, gentlemen.

What are your current positions and expectations for them?,1609608285,wellthenthiswashard,16,"I know everyone is already holding $GME and $PLTR until they lands on the moon but maybe we can find out what new tickers everyone is holding, why and what are their expectations.

Here is a list of my current positions;

* 70 shares of $BABA at an average of $245 with a price target of $265, where I'll liquidate unless the political environment gets better.
   * COVID proof
   * Solid financials, much more liquid than Amazon
   * China is bound to become the largest economy
   * Political uncertainties are exaggerated
* 70 shares of $CRM at $221 with a price target of $230. Have made this same play quite a few times in the last 2 months.
   * COVID proof
   * A solid company run by a solid CEO with good growth and financials
   * Slack was purchased for $28b but the market has wiped 26% of its market cap off, which is more than $50b so at the very least the overreaction is extended by at least $22b (a 10% increase in market cap from current levels)
   * Short-term PT of $230 but have no doubt this can break above $275 in 2021. A 24% upside.
* 24 shares of $FB at $273 with a price target of $280. Have also done this multiple times during the last few months.
   * COVID proof
   * Earnings coming up near the end of January.
   * Zuck might be a lizard, but those IG ""influencers"" you follow from your fake account so your girlfriend doesn't find out will only keep luring you back in.
   * Political risks surrounding breakup are exaggerated and seem to be an optic play to gain public confidence. Even if this is not the case, the first hearing is years away.
   * Has the potential to breach $325 during 2021. An upside of 20%.
* 4 shares of $AMZN at $3250 with a price target of $3350 at least. Have made a bit over $5k only trading swings between $3000 and $3350.
   * COVID proof
   * Earnings coming up near the end of January.
   * Possible to reach ATH which is around $3500 near earnings.
   * Possible to breach $4000 during the year providing an upside of 23%.
* 275 shares of $PFE at average $38.62 with a price target of $41-42, not sure how this will go. Have made this play once before when I cashed out at $42.75 just a few weeks ago.
   * Only speculative play in my portfolio
   * Not a hold in the long run as this stock is as limp as they come but a reasonable dividend yield. So, not really worried about losing money.

Pretty boring shit, no $GME or $PLTR here but looking forward to seeing what other tickers the community is holding on to."

Disclaimer Iâ€™m in with 600 shares 

- [ ] The most important factors for them going into 2021:
- [ ] Can they pull off their marketing campaign? 
- [ ] Will the plant based movement continue?
IMO yes, its spreading like wildfire in the US, huge demand for it in the UK.
Gen Z and Millenials driving the plant based movement.
Theyâ€™re very connected with social medias can help spread the name in a massive way
- [ ] Trend will continue to grow stronger.
- [ ] $55B market theyâ€™re targeting aggressively to take market share of next year
- [ ] Donâ€™t underestimate the power of brand awareness, this can snowball and be a huge driver for them
- [ ] Can argue brand awareness is what will impact the fundamentals and sp the most
Just scratching the surface of their distribution potential.
Now apparently selling in the UK Costcoâ€™s already, US wide expansion aswell as Mexico

Tons of pictures of empty shelves and their products being sold out on social medias

https://skyhighcapitalinvestments.com/the-most-exciting-food-company-for-the-next-decade-and-beyond/

- [ ] This time of year January people tend to eat healthier, the Q1 report should reflect this boost in sales on top of the benefits of their marketing 

Veganuary 
NitroC advertising company 


- [ ] Vertically integrated: 
- [ ] Meaing they produce everything in their products right from the source
- [ ] They grow their own vegetables and ingredients
- [ ] Manuafacture the final product themselves
- [ ] They innovate rapidly and design their own products aswell
- [ ] This is essential to keep ahead of competitors in the food space.

Catalystâ€™s
Marketing campaign = massive buzz around the brand higher revenue, higher sales.
Biggest catalyst for the history of this company
A lot of positive reviews on social medias like IG and YT
Effect of Marketing campaign really be seen in Q1 earnings 

Undervalued, institutional investors will be loading up on this 

The hype from the SPAC alone has been free advertising 90m in cash from merger 
Cash will be 320m if they call the warrants
(May be exercised next year at some point)companies in their growth stage and attacking a major opportunity. 

Price prediction:

Profitability is not and should not be their main concern which is why I am using Price to sales to compare their valuations:

TTCF have been profitable every quarter also to mention, except Q3 because of one off merger expenses.

Based on P/S ratio:
2021 sp: $45 conservative
          sp: $56 very possible with 3.8B market cap

Q4 potential YOY rev, I have 45
On their analyst day presentation says 39 (conservative)
With them selling out crazy fast in the stores
I canâ€™t see why they wonâ€™t smash their Q4 earnings

Currently SKUâ€™s 21 products
Will have 38 products in 2021
This aggressive expansion = more sales = higher revenue

Addressable market is about 50B growing at at 17% CAGR for that market. Their revenue has been about 40-50m quarterly WITHOUT ANY MARKETING AT ALL.
Should be crazy growth once the marketing campaign starts in Jan.

They should be able to maintain and grow these numbers for years to come, innovation is key here and they have the scope to do it.
And the capacity as theyâ€™ve double their facility size already and plan to scale up again in 2021 doubling facilities again.

RISKS

Risks - Of course marketing is costly and possibility of it not being successful
But TTCF seem to have a very loyal customer base already and their products actually taste good
Other alternative type products donâ€™t taste that great just loaded with salt. 
Overall very excited for their next earnings report.

There are 20M warrants outstanding. 
If they call the warrants that would be an 85M shares outstanding
So TTCF is 85M shares outstanding and $320M in the bank, accounting for the warrant excercise.
What does this mean for the stock price, it can cause dilution if the warrants are exercised, because the underlying company ie TTCF will have to issue new shares, when thereâ€™s more shares the price is diluted by the extra amount of shares created. However in the overall long term picture for TTCF this will be minor.

Conclusion:

In my opinion this a trend that will continue to be strong in 2021, just like what weâ€™ve seen in the EV space. From the start of next year TTCF will be spending aggresively on marketing
Could mean weâ€™ll see some very attractive results in their next Q4, Q1 and onwards earnings reports!!
Solid long term hold, I want to get in early before it takes off."

Alibaba is UNDERVALUED ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€,1609612189,UnpolishedPleb,134,"One after another negative catalysts have been annihilating Alibabaâ€™s share price. First it was the [ANT IPO fiasco](https://imgur.com/kDpBPlg) and then it was CCP regulatory concerns. Do you really think the CCP is on a warpath to meaningfully hinder one of their most profitable companies? If so then stop reading here. This is literally a gift from the CCP and here is why.

First lets start off with some fundamental boomer valuation metrics. According to Nasdaq.com hereâ€™s a comparison of the two largest e-commerce companies.

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” 

ALIBABA Forward P/E: 

2021: 30 

2022: 23 

2023: 17

12 month Forward PEG ratio: 1.46

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” 

AMAZON Forward P/E: 

2021: 73 

2022: 52 

2023:(no estimates)

12 month Forward PEG ratio: 3.22 

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-

As you can see Alibaba is CRITICALLY undervalued compared to Amazon. When PEG is taken into account with P/E it can justify a currently high P/E IF AND ONLY IF said company is expected to grow earnings fast enough YOY. According to Zackâ€™s the E-commerce industry as a whole has a PEG ratio of about 2.56 which would indicate that Alibaba is undervalued in comparison to not only Amazon but most if not all of its peers as well. Lets also not forget that Alibaba recently increased their [share buyback program from 6 billion to 10 bilion](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/alibaba-raises-stock-buyback-plan-to-10-billion-but-stock-continues-to-sink-11609124627). That's an increase of over 66%.... Even Alibaba themselves thinks their shares are undervalued and wants to take advantage of the recent sell off.

Secondly lets check out the technical side of things. Here is a [weekly chart](https://imgur.com/5ffIMmO) that shows a very attractive uptrending pattern for the last few years. It also shows that Alibaba was overextended and needed a healthy pullback. Now it's oversold and in prime territory for a true dip buy opportunity. An opportunity this large has presented itself just 4 times in a little over 2 years. The huge green candle tells me that after the sell off Alibaba bulls were lying in wait for a moment like this to scoop up more shares. 

Lastly  lets break it down in WSB valuation metrics. Daniel Zhang YOLOd his way into an empire and his wifeâ€™s boyfriend(The CCP) has noticed that he is incredibly profitable and doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon. The wife's boyfriend is starting to fear for his top position in the house. This is why the wif'es boyfriend wants to regulate the little autist so that he can maintain power over both his wife and the autist. That said the wife's boyfriend doesn't' want to kick the autist out. He still wants to keep the little autist around because he generates money for him while he hangs out with his wife. 

TLDR; The CCP wants to make sure it stays in position as the wife's boyfriend. Alibaba is undervalued and presents an opportunity if you believe the CCP regulatory concerns are just smoke and mirrors."

I'm trying to look more into short squeezes and kind of put all the (justified) hype into historical context. What are some other well known short squeezes that could be used as comparisons?

Everyone brings up the VW ""infinity squeeze"" which happened on only a 12.3% Short Interest and 6% of Free float at the time. 

But with GME the short interest is at a ludicrous 97.68% according to Yahoo Finance and the free float is 69%. So the VW squeeze was worse in term of the ratio of short interest to float

I have a gift for buying the right things for the wrong reasons, despite this, I decided to dive in balls deep when Palantir ipo'd. As my investment grew, I wasn't too phased since picking good investments is normal to me. Curious, I decide to browse the wallstreetbets sub only to be dissappointed to see that you retards had been all over this stock already. Did I think that I was going against the herd by buying this stock? yes. Are you guys the only reason this stock went up?

NO!

yOU autist have just stumbled upon one of the greatest stocks of all time! As said previously in my comment, it is my belief that an artificially intelligent all seeing machine will soon run the world. I have called it the Basilisk, named after Roko's Basilisk. Palantir is essentially the head of the snake. And with the inevitable introduction of AVA, I am laughing to the bank. Metroplolis \[1927\], The Matrix \[1999\], Eagle eye \[2008\], 2001: A space odyssey \[1968\], Idiocracy \[2006\], 1984 \[1984\]- This was all investment grade material that you should have been studying. 

Now i doubt any of you actually have any money left to buy calls or leaps, but understand this.

If Palantir is successful in the future, human freedom won't exist. But you will be rich. The Basilisk will see to it that you are rewarded for assisting in it's creation."

I need the app or program you guys use to buy and other tips on where I can learn this stuff. I tried googling and read many articles but they honestly just confuse me more and more and I actually dont really know what you guys are doing. Is this day trading, investing in shares or what exactly is it called? For some context when I tried to start learning I went on ""[tradingview.com](https://tradingview.com)"" and looked at many stocks for a few weeks and used the papertrading method so I could learn how it works. I did gain about 100 virtual dollars but I didn't really understand what I was doing. I just bought Tesla shares and Euro/Dollar and then when it went up I closed the positions and boom I got the +100$. 

I really want to educate myself and learn and I think I can be able to do so since I also taught myself how to code and become a software and game developer but I don't know where to look for. 

Can you please provide some sources, courses or something where I can start slowly to get into this stuff and understand and then go one step after another?

""GME GONNA BE BANKRUPT HUUR DURR"" - GME bears

If GME was going bankrupt, it would've done so already during the lockdown, not in the beginning of a console cycle. Here's a brief look at the credit markets backdrop and I'll explain why GME won't go bankrupt anytime soon and is in fact very bullish for GME.

I'm not gonna go into how GME improved their balance sheets and got FCF, lots of people did that already, but I'll say something in WSB terms. Printers go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR yo. When the IG and HYG credit market went to shit back in March and April, JPOW pulled out his magnificent printers and set it to BRR mode, the end result is well functioning credit markets with spreads that are tight af. With yields in treasuries and IG being low, people are forced to look for yield in junk bonds. This is why you hear about how CCL was able to raise debt without using ships as collateral and airlines using their flyer points as collateral to raise debt. Creditors are willing to lend at laughable rates  just to get yield. Now GME doesn't need to raise more debt, it is meeting it obligations early but if it ever needs to raise capital for future growth operations, they can easily raise capital in the credit market for as long as JPOW sets the printer in BRR mode. Which we know won't change until at least 2023, I honestly think it'll be longer than that  but it doesn't matter anyways since wsb doesn't even look 6 months out ahead. Notice how we haven't had as much bankruptcies as people thought we would ?(small businesses don't count) Well that's because of our great lord and savior, JPOW

So there you have it, betting on GME bankruptcy is essentially betting against JPOW losing control of the credit market. **JPOW is in effect GME gang's daddy #1**. (iloveyoujpow) 

""BUT GME HAD NEGATIVE EPS FOR SO MANY YEARS!"" - more gay GME bears

You see the problem with bears is that they are always backwards looking, no vision for the future, no hopes for anything, always depressing. For some reason they can't understand that a lot of the market participants are writing off 2020 because of the pandemic, they also can't understand GME is cyclical and moves along with the console cycle, meaning we are now in the early days of a gme pump. Their inability to look forward is in fact the number 1 reason why their wives have chad forward looking boyfriends. **Our forward looking chad is of course Ryan Cohen (Daddy #2)**, I don't even need to explain more, but GME GANG daddy #2 obviously has a vision and he is more than ready to double down on his bet, buying GME at $16 just two weeks ago. He had a few mysterious tweets recently and people are speculating that he is ready to make another move. I'm not going to join the speculation  but the fact that he bought at $16 means that is probably the floor price and I would go all in with calls if it ever dips below that.  

""THEY HAVE NO VIABLE BUSINESS MODEL IN THE AGE OF ECOMMERCE"" - Gay bear and Melvin capital

We have to give credit where it's due, Melvin capital likely had significant alpha with their investment thesis. If you look at their holdings, you'll see that they are long ecommerce and short specialty retail. They saw the demise of various brick and mortar stores back around 2015 and executed on that thesis. I'd argue that the covid pandemic essentially pulled forward all the earnings growth and priced in a lot of that growth with high PE multiples. The problem with that thesis is that it is now old, ecommerce is a crowded trade and this will not be an alpha generating thesis.  The best way to generate alpha is now to invest in a new counter thesis that can outperform the crowded ecommerce thesis. 

Omnichannel is one of such counter thesis, it's starting to get hyped everywhere. This is why Sherman repeats that word like he's autistic, this guy probably mutters it while banging his wife but judging by his conference call, she's probably never been excited by him. Likely he doesn't know how to execute on that thesis, thank god for GME GANG DADDY RC. 

That's not to say he is useless, despite all the shit we gave him. Sherman managed to close down unprofitable stores, reduced inventory and got cashflow positive during a pandemic. This is textbook shit but still very important. and despite the letters RC put out, he could be very receptive of his ideas for all we know. He has shown to be somewhat shareholder friendly through previous buybacks and he did not rule out further share buybacks. Sherman himself holds over 1million shares and has not yet sold them as far as I know. The shelf offering concerns seems to have faded for now, and it will become smaller as the stock price increases. I really just think GME management wants to use that to capitalize on any potential pumps in the stock. This will probably be re-invested anyways.

So what did GME do so far to improve its business model? So far I've seen the following

1. Pivot to ecommerce and improving ecommerce sales - which has seen decent growth
2. Diversifying sales to include more high margin items like PC accessories, PC monitors, etc ( If I speculate, there may be partnerships with certain brands
3. Focusing on loyalty programs like power ups - I'll never understand loyalty programs but some people are retardedly loyal to stores that offer rewards. If they can offer good incentives they can achieve high conversion rates , as far as I know, GameStop is the only specialty video game retailer in north America that offers such reward programs.
4. Store rebranding - this might be good for their goodwill, which got hammered over the years

Daddy RC has more plans for GME and we can only speculate what they might be right now, but with 12% stake, he has what he needs to go full on activist on the BoD. I expect to see some departures and replacements in the reasonably near future. 

If that's not enough for you, here's a few more possible catalysts for the stock that I don't see a lot of people mentioning 

1. A possible new Nintendo console release in \~1-2 years 
2. Currently distressed commercial REITs = ability to negotiate lower rent = more $$$
3. Likely return of inflation (debatable but money supply ballooned and we are seeing velocity pick up a bit) with JPOW promising to keep rates at 0% even when inflation comes back = bullish for all stocks, bears will get slaughtered
4. OG printer Yellen manning the treasury in a month + possible dem senate = more stimmy checks = more money going into GME
5. If sales improve and balance sheets continue improve, we might see more credit upgrades 
6. Better sales = possible dividend re-instatement , I couldn't care less about dividends but guess who's going to be paying? The shorts lol.  If Sherman had balls, he would pull an OSTK and announce a special dividend , which will actually lead to a short squeeze while wsb laughs collectively as  we get meme returns from this boomer move. 

I'm sure the OG GME bulls can think of more reasons, I've been in and out of GME since it was at $9 (my CC's kept on getting assigned).

Current positions

500x GME shares - ready to buy more at the dip Monday and Tuesday, going to sell a few puts

15x Apr $20c Leaps

10x  Jan 15 $20c YOLOs

So does this mean I think GME will squeeze to $69 by next friday? No. GME short interest has been high for years, Melvin capital isn't going to be that worried since their GME position is likely hedged and not a big part of their holdings (they're probably laughing at wsb for all the memes we put out). We will likely have a few more dips next week which I will buy. Depending on how much WSB pumps GME before ICR or console sale release (which I expect to be lackluster due to shortages), I'll either take profit or sell some ITM calls if IV's are high. Then buy the dip.

TLDR:   
GME bankruptcy is out of the question for the next 3-5 years because of the macro and credit market, RC is putting a floor of $16 on the price (debatable but you're welcome to buy puts or short below $16). bears need to stop looking backwards and be anticipatory. GME short squeeze likely not going to happen overnight but a bit slowly as more people realize GME isn't going bankrupt and either buy in or cover their short positions."

I have some stocks in my portfolio that i strongly believe that they will go up with a big ratios in future. Yet im still making not too much money so i buy that stocks very poorly with so small amounts every month. Now one of them increased %70 in a day and because my money on that stock is so low i didnt wanna sell, because in long term i believe it will contiune to grow. Yet now the stock came back to its normal value and i got nothing from that huge jump. Should i sell the little percentage or sell the whole stock in that time? I always hear its nice to buy more when the stocks that you trust go down, but what to do when its up?"

Palantir (PLTR) is heavily exposed to oil and gas prices... what?,1609636118,ArcheronX,56,"Just watched a short clip on CNBC which was explaining why a bunch of IPO stocks were down in the final week of trading for 2020. Gina Sanchez stated Palantir was down due to heavy exposure to the oil and gas industry but that makes zero sense to me as I don't see how oil prices are even related to a big data company like Palantir.

Can someone explain to me how lying on national T.V is allowed? 

Quote - ""Palantirâ€™s stock could also get hit for a while, after debuting at a lofty valuation, she said, raising concerns about the companyâ€™s exposure to the struggling oil and gas industry.""

PLTR most important software company in the world,1609636757,AffectionateHawk4422,309,"This is easy fucktards, so listen up. PLTR is a bull stock and is going to the moon. So if you are not a bull and you are one of the following:

&amp;#x200B;

1. A punk ass b%$#ch
2. Crybaby
3. Paperhand motherfucker
4. Part of shitron
5. Suffer extreme anxiety seeing a stock unable to go up, EVERY single day. Even after is up 137% since the DPO... Remember the stock has less than a year!

Then DON'T buy it. This isn't BAC or C, GE, AAPL, or any other stock that is more stable. This is a big swinging dick motherfucker that can go up, down, sideways, or where ever it pleases. If you can't handle that, then GTFO and back to paper trading. 

Now if you are a pro, a true retard, an autist savant a badass motherfucker that has balls of steel and can stand pressure like none other, then this DD is for you. You are buying what papa Karp said will be the next MOST important software company in the world (""**We are going to be the most important software company in the world**""). And the guy couldn't care less about the current stock price because the stock will be mooning, volatility is obviously expected when pricing a stock:

""we are very comfortable with investors toying around that it could be like this it could be like that, we are gonna the world best software"" Alex Karp. CNBC interview. 

Some of you might be afraid because the stock is overvalued and the lockup period and this and that. **I'm just going to point out something ABSOLUTELY critical:**

&amp;#x200B;

**Snowflake** (NYSE:SNOW)

PS Ratio: 162

**IPO**

**C3.AI** (NYSE:AI)

PS Ratio: 81.96

**IPO**

**U** (NYSE:U)

PS Ratio: 81.96

**IPO**

&amp;#x200B;

And our dear Palantir has: 

PS ratio: 44.23

Launched into the market as a: **DPO**

And what is everybody saying about PLTR? No, the stock is extremely overvalued, shorted by citron and bla bla bla. You wanna know why the first two are not being shorted? Their price targets not lowered? Yeah, because they were launched as IPO by the big banks. Almost nobody is saying shit about SNOW, even though the company is astronomically overvalued. That stock is covered in ointment made from JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and every other major bank. Because well, they don't like getting a cold shoulder and have it IN for PLTR.  

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**: You are betting on a company that will be worth at least X30 times what is worth now.  Give it time, stop being a crybaby or a paper hand MF. 

&amp;#x200B;

PS. Remmeber papa Karp will be giving a talk on Jan 7.

DIS: Moon Mission 2021,1609637612,baggholder420,41,"**Prediction: DIS may soon surpass 200 at early 2021, and potentially to trade between 250--300 this year. How fast it rises will depend on streaming growth. If the subscription continues to add 20M per Q, it will be the next $420 / 1T company within 1-2 years.**

&amp;#x200B;

As a long-time bagholder of TSLA (disclaimer: not any more), DIS in 2020 reminds me a lot of TSLA in 2019: Stock went down big-time during Q1 due to impacted business; slowly recovered throughout the year, then quickly ATH at year-end due to future growth (TSLA last Q4 for improved delivery and cybertruck event; DIS this Q4 bc streaming growth and investor day).

Bears argue the park business is down, a lack of new contents on Disney +, and stock overvalued on current revenue. Bulls believe the pent-up demand of park after covid, a sea of new contents coming to Disney +, and potentialy hyper growth in streaming revenueu. It is strikingly similar to the debates around TSLA for years (and in fact many growth stocks). And bears always lose because investors love growth at end of the day.

This year there will be &gt;10 Disney movies on Disney + premiere access in 2021, vs just Mulan in 2020, plus many other TV series and movies only on Disney +. Given DIS's superior brands, top cultural influence, and unrivalled quality, if streaming growth is able to break into 200M-300M subscribers in 1-2 years, there will be huge profit and cash &amp; DIS will break 1T at that point.

&amp;#x200B;

Going forward, every ER they update the subscription number, it may boost the stock price. **The stock currently has many short-term catalysts for the next ER:**

1. At 35% capacity, Disney FL Parks are extremely full. It regularly hits capacity since November, is all sold out for New Year Eve. And China Park has been open and on fire for the whole quarter. This is a strong signal for park's pent up demand, and bolds well for DIS revenue in Q4.
2. Soul turns out to be an unexpected success, and is globally acclaimed. Not really a kids movie, but widely praised and may become an Oscar winner. Box-office wise, it has grossed over USD 20M in China in a week, gaining more and more popularity despite zero ads in China  (10M in past two days alone), and is expected to gross 60M-100M in China at least.
3. With Mando last two episodes, Soul, and Mulan all appearing on Disney + for free during December (especially they are on Disney + after 12.2, the cut-off date for the 86.8M subscriber disclosed on DIS investor day), Disney + shall have a subscriber count of 90--100M as of end of 2020. Any number within the range is bullish --- if they can hit close to 100M, it will be perceived as a monumental success (imagine &gt;10M subscriber for one month only!), showing investors the big power of Disney brand, and may immediately rocket the stock to 250.
4. With increased park revenue and DIS + growth in this Q, DIS has a good chance to beat Q4 estimates for revenue and profit (based on Yahoo finance). And they have beat twice in past two Q.

It does not mean the stock has no risk, if the streaming growth slows down in a material way, or Macro uncertainty rises again, then stock will certainty react negatively.

Strategy-wise, do stocks or leaps --- stocks will double or triple, and leaps have a chance to five-fold or more at current streaming growth. I personally hold 2022 and 2023 leaps. No weeklies --- if the stock is no higher than 200 at early Feb, and no change in company prospect then, it may worth a small try on ER calls then.

Feel free to short the stock --- imagine betting against a strong growth story, the most iconic company, a kids-favorite brand, the best animation studio, the legend of galaxy, and all the superheroes --- it is as bad as betting against Elon, if not more so (and throughout 2019, many bet against Elon)."

$TPII will explode in 2021,1609639517,SpittinOpinions,2,"Triad Pro Innovators ($TPII) has developed proprietary battery technology for use in multiple industries. Their battery is green, eco, and can pair with solar and never need to be plugged in. It has the potential to replace lithium batteries. They have proved their concept within the EV industry with golf carts and are set to announce further applications within the EV market, next with light trucks. Their potential with off-grid batteries and other energy storage is huge!

$TPII has a ridiculously small $7 million market cap and is currently at $0.11 per share. I absolutely expect them to run to $1.00+ in January and $5.00+ easily in 2021. Other similar companies with lesser technologies and companies that own no patents have blown up in price recently. $TPII owns patents and has full control of their tech. They are barely known and once word fully gets out and people see the potential, their price will explode.

I have spoken with Murray Goldenberg, President of Triad Pro Innovators. His number is available if you look for it but I can't post it here. He is aware of the recent uptick in investor interest in his company. Here is his update:

 â€¢ They currently have three EV products developed that use their prorpietary e-cell technology. The SPREE golf cart is just one of them and he wouldn't share what the other two are because it hasn't been made public. It is safe to assume one of them is small trucks. They have other applications for their technology developed and in development also. Updates are pending.

 â€¢ They are currently selling the golf cart and sales have increased recently. However they have their sights on bigger markets. The golf cart proved their concept and validated their technology. 

 â€¢ They are in contact with several different firms to help with the funding. COVID has caused some delays but something should be sorted out very soon. They have no toxic funding currently and will not take any on.

 â€¢ They do plan on addressing the public soon, likely early in 2021. They started their Twitter account in December and have hinted a bit at things to come. Expect press releases in January.

 â€¢ He believes the technology they have created is so great that they intend to take their time and do everything correctly.

 â€¢ He invited me to their Arizona facility for a tour and demonstration of their technology, but I declined as that is nowhere near where I live

In short, $TPII absolutely has something. They need to finish the coordination of funding and develop a sound go-to-market strategy. This will happen and is already in the works.Â $TPIIÂ will soar when they make an announcement. He has spoken with counsel about doing that right. Murray came off as a genuine guy who knows they have something special. This is a real company with real, revolutionary technology. Their $7 million market cap is a function of them keeping silent while they perfect their tech. They're ready to start moving now."

***A single prediction for the New Year.***

*Those unfamiliar with the Federal Reserve Boardâ€™s Regulation T will hear lots about it during 2021. The rule limits the percentage of an investment in equity securities that can be borrowed with a margin loan. A wake-up call is scheduled...*

*It was widely reported this week that total margin debt reached a new high of $722B. The WSJâ€™s 12/28 lead Business and Finance story profiled a $TSLA retail investor, a civil engineer, who had parlayed a $23k option investment in $TSLA into a $2m position. Oh boy. The gentleman is to surely and genuinely be commended for the investment. An 87x gain in a short period is extraordinary (I've never done that, nor will I). That said, a quick perusal of $TSLA twitter commentary and recommendations is terrifying.*

*One can read the Journal article,* [*Investors Double Down on Stocks, Pushing Margin Debt to Record TSLA*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-double-down-on-stocks-pushing-margin-debt-to-record-11609077600)*, and draw two conclusions. One, â€œThis must be extremely dangerous,â€ or two, â€œSurely I can get rich quick too.â€ Human nature being what it isâ€¦ For the latter, the civil engineer offers this advice on his Twitter page, â€œIf you have no Tesla call options, you may want to do the math and consider using LEAPS as a way to accelerate your accumulation of Tesla stock. 40X in 2020. Another 50X by 2025.â€ Whoa.*

*A series of Q&amp;A tweets ensues (thanks for the heads up* [*@RomanRubinstein*](https://twitter.com/romanrubinstein?lang=en)*) on which broker/dealers offer the most margin, the lowest interest rate on margin debt, and how to borrow the most money and obtain the maximum leverage by purchasing call options. â€œMaintain margin value of 50% in my portfolio and the margin borrowing rides forever,â€ goes the advice. Please consider the danger of heeding this advice. The engineer should risk-off and live a happy life.*

*A whole bunch of people are going to lose a whole bunch of money.*

*Reading through a series of tweets among the Tesla (and others) option crowd, you see little, if any, mention of maintenance margin requirements. FINRA requires investors, strike that, speculators, to maintain equity of at least 25% of the value of an account. Leverage kills. Maintenance rates can be set above the minimum threshold. The concept of posting shares in stocks like $TSLA, $TWTR, or any established company trading for 20x or 30x sales &amp; borrowing half of the value and then buying calls on the same shares posted as collateral is insanity. The only â€œmathâ€ a speculator should be doing is knowing at what price against the shares in the account will new equity be required. Most brokers donâ€™t wait around for a customer to come up with new cash or securities to deposit. What do they do?*

*They sell down your shares to get to equity compliance. More decline? More forced selling. Depending on maintenance margin thresholds, you can lose it all in a hurry. Red flags are abundant, beyond simply the new record high in total margin and credit market debt outstanding. You can see the bubble in the number of single-contract call options outstanding, in the number of new retail accounts being opened with margin and allowed option trading, and even in the tone of surety by speculators regarding prospects for wildly expensive shares like Tesla.*

*I never thought Iâ€™d again see the kind of mania like we saw in the late 1990â€™s, but here we are. Memories of what can and is likely to happen are long gone. Even a number of professional investors have suspended price as a key determinant of value.  A respected and well-known retired professional investor suggested on Twitter recently that I donâ€™t understand â€œ$TSLA growth math or basic investment theory,â€ that â€œstocks look forward, not backwardâ€ and that â€œP/Eâ€™s are a function of exponential growth rates, not industry.â€*

*The last time an investment pro came unglued was January 2000 at a newspaper roundtable. The C.I.O/PM for one of the largest &amp; oldest growth &amp; income funds at the time took exception to the notion that $MSFT shareholders would lose money for the next 15 years, which they did. Iâ€™d written 6 pages on the prediction in my 1/1/2000 letter (on the website) and discussed it at the roundtable. My co-panelist became unhinged because he and his firm had 5% of capital in $MSFT, which was then a $620B market cap on $20B in sales, 31x sales &amp; 80x earnings.*

*You can apply the same logic to $TSLA or to any number of dangerously overvalued fashionable disruptive growers today. The Tesla bull proffering margined purchase of $TSLA LEAPS expects a $1,000 share price this year, $5,000 the next and $22,000 by 2025.*

*Now, a $22,000 stock price, assuming no further dilution above todayâ€™s 1.1B fully diluted shares outstanding, gets you to a $24 trillion market value, which must be reasonable given that the entire market value of the S&amp;P 500 today is only \~$31 trillion &amp; global GDP is $88T. When your TAM (the new eyeballs) is 100% global auto market share, robotaxi, energy grid, insurance and economic population of Mars, no price is too high. No argument that Tesla has made great strides in manufacturing efficiency and are now producing a more reliable product.*

*I also believe disruption of the auto industry will require an enormous amount of capital to grow and the established OEMâ€™s wonâ€™t play dead. You can't simply separate auto margins and capital requirements from nearly infinite profitability earned by selling software upgrades. Shouldnâ€™t the upgrades be considered part of total vehicle cost? To what extent did the Apples and Microsofts of the world thrive on a regular upgrade cycle, much of which was and is planned. How often are you compelled into a new iPhone or iPad? Prior to the subscription model, at what point did Microsoft not support an older operating system or Office suite? Will EV buyers purchase a new car every 2-3 years? How much of the world can afford a more expensive vehicle than the current global average car price?*

*Regardless of one's beliefs on business quality &amp; growth prospects, paying a too-high price can destroy future investment return. #neversell? When price becomes ridiculous to the most optimistic business case you #bettersell. Price matters and the current environment is nuts. The current folly for price not mattering, or being justifiably high, reminds me of a well known sell-side report on Berkshire Hathaway in 1998 which assumed as undervalued both $BRKâ€™s shares and its stock portfolio against an assumed â€œreasonableâ€ 40x market multiple.*

*Berkshireâ€™s shares, expensive, would fall by half over the next 18 months to a February 2000 low. Itâ€™s become fashionable to explain investment process by saying price is the last consideration. Too often lately, price isnâ€™t even a consideration, especially for holy growers. While I did not have a short position on $MSFT in 2000, I do have a very small recent short on Tesla today so take my comments w/ a grain of salt. I did buy $MSFT in '06 after it fell by \~75% and owned it for a decade, trimming when dear and adding to the position when cheap.*

*Short selling is very risky and those w/ sizable short positions on Tesla at the outset of 2020 would have suffered real damage given the 720% advance during the year. I've read that shorts lost $38B during '20 alone on their collective positions &amp; short interest is way down. I happen to think the valuation is now so large to protect against a continued runaway price, particularly now that* u/elonmusk *secured its entry in the S&amp;P 500 by engineering 4 quarters of profits by cutting R&amp;D, SG&amp;A and thanks to environmental credits courtesy $GM &amp; $FCA.*

*Still, Iâ€™d never employ a large short position given unlimited downside and a max return of 100%. Margin is required against short positions. What appears to be a growing army of retail option traders, many employing sizable margin debt, is a recipe for disaster. Price and quality conscious investors get uncomfortable at times like these. I am extremely uncomfortable. I hope those that have no idea what they are doing heed growing and now very high risk and fully understand downside and what margin calls and maintenance margin mean.*

*Many, many speculators will lose much and even all of their money at some point as this bubble breaks. Now is the time to reduce risk. You could feel badly for employees that were paid in non-qualified stock options and kept their shares upon exercise in the late 1990â€™s. When shares plummeted in the wake of the tech bubble the tax liability due on gain realized as income upon exercise was still due and payable, despite shares that were way below the exercise price. It was bad. Many lost everything but werenâ€™t in a position to understand risk.*

*Borrowing against Tesla (or any) shares and buying call options presents serious deliberately assumed risk. For perspective, a 92% decline takes the shares back to where they started 2020! With margin, it will take way less than a 92% decline to introduce wipeout.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Responding to a PM who claims that the $TSLA price target of $1,200, total EV adoption of 20%, and 5% market share in global auto-manufacturing is reasonable, Bloomstran had this to say:**

*You have EV adoption rising from 3% to 20% in five years, a 6x increase (46% CAGR) and Tesla market share at 25%. 2019 global new vehicle sales totaled \~95m units and will be way lower this year. Let's call 2020 a throwaway for the industry, and hats off to* [*$TSLA*](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click) *for growing. From the 2019 base, if we assume 4% market growth then new global units in 2025 would be 115m and at your expected 20% share Tesla would sell 29 million vehicles. Is this your assumption? Sounds aggressive given Teslaâ€™s 500k unit run rate for 2020 and 1/2% market share.*

*Now, US new vehicle prices are $38k but significantly lower worldwide, letâ€™s say $30k per vehicle sold globally. The average Tesla looks to range from high $30kâ€™s for the Model 3 to $55k for the Model 3 Performance to $125k for the Model X Performance fully loaded.  What do you expect for an average selling price for Tesla in 2025? Iâ€™d presume that as market share expands ASPâ€™s will have to fall to affordable. Iâ€™m trying to get to a revenue number.*

*Perhaps the governments of the world will be giving $2k per person, $8k per family of 4 in annual perpetuity, surely making new cars more affordable! If Tesla sells 29m units in 2025 @ $34.5k per unit, that gets sales to $1 trillion, a CAGR of \~102% for five years. Reasonable?*

*Moving on, you have a 2025 EPS target of $24/share. On how many shares shall we apply your expected per-share figure? Shares outstanding at 9/30 totaled 948m, up from 905m at yearend 2019. An additional $5B in shares were sold recently to the public in â€œat-the-marketâ€ sales.  The sales were done with no roadshow, risk disclosure or prospectus, unless Goldmanâ€™s report upgrading the shares from neutral to buy &amp; a new price target of $780, up from $455, issued days before the announced sale and Goldmanâ€™s retention as selling agent, as a â€œprospectus.""*

*If the shares were sold at an average of \~$600/share, the share count would now be 8.3m shares higher, so call the total 956m. You have a price target of $1,200 for the shares, so letâ€™s not forget to include in the count any option and RSU shares issued but not yet exercised.  Recall,* [*@elonmusk*](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) *was granted 20m option shares (now 100m thanks to the split) in 2018 by* [*@larryellison*](https://twitter.com/larryellison) *and Elonâ€™s associates on the board. Fully diluted shares total 1.113B right now, and if the stock keeps rising we can assume all options will be exercised and outstanding.*

*So, how many shares should we apply to your $24 EPS target? If we assume zero further dilution (realistic?), then using the 1.113B fully diluted shares including the recent $5b sale, we get to $26.7B in net income. On an even $1 trillion in revenues, thatâ€™s a 2.67% profit margin, just a bit higher than the auto industry average of 3% and approaching $MSFTâ€™s 30%.*

*One last missing piece of information, which I havenâ€™t seen mentioned by the Tesla bulls or in your message to me is how much capital will be required to grow sales from 500k units to 29m over the next 5 years?  It looks like over the history of* [*$TSLA*](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click) *the company has raised $26.5B in equity capital (including the recent $5B) and $16.5B in debt and preferred equity, so a total of $43B. Tesla has a cumulative loss of $5.7B, so it hasnâ€™t produced a positive return on capital.*

*For its last 4 quarters GAAP profits totaled $5.56B, which yields a 2.5% return on capital (equity net of retained losses plus debt minus cash, all adjusted for the recent $5B sale). I fully understand companies can surely lose money or earn little profit as they scale.  With the recent sale of $5B Tesla now has \~$20B in cash. Is this sufficient to finance its growth over the next 5 years as the company grows units by 102% per year?*

*Since I donâ€™t lean on brevity and given my lack of understanding of basic investment theory, letâ€™s summarize the missing data points necessary to get the stock to your target of $1,200 per share, 50 times your 2025 EPS target of $24 per share. Needed: 1) Tesla unit sales in 2025? 2) Average selling price per unit? 3) Any non-auto related sales â€“ insurance, robotaxi, insurance, energy sales? 4) Shares outstanding? 5) Total capital: Additional paid in capital, debt, preferred equity, cash?*

*At your 50x $24 EPS $1,200  price target,* [*$TSLA*](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click) *returns 11.2% pa from Thursdayâ€™s $705.67 close. I happen to think shares in* [*$BRK*](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BRK&amp;src=cashtag_click)*, my largest holding, are likely to compound at roughly that rate, assuming a 10% ROE and a terminal price at 1.3x book value, up from \~1.2x today.*"

TLRY Tendy Update,1609641614,mjfarraher88,44,"Hey everyone,

Back at it with an update from my post a few weeks ago. Been following the GA Runoff day in and day out. Been backing up the truck with 126 TLRY Calls to $15 expiring in March, and still adding.

Hereâ€™s what I got:

-Voter turnout has been great and demographics strongly favor a democratic win, for now. Early/absentee votes shattered the old runoff record in GA; so far over 3m votes have been cast (record is 2.1m votes TOTAL.)

-Over 100k new votes have been cast, thereâ€™s a huge young registrant vote, and 38% of all registered voters in GA have voted.

-Dems have out-raised Republicans about 2:1.

-Polls favor a Democratic victory, but polls usually lean left. Whatâ€™s interest is that the betting odds have shifted more in favor of Democrats, yet Republicans are still the favorite as the probability of Democrats taking both seats is a harder feat by the numbers.

-Lastly, Trumps rhetoric about voter fraud and rigged elections, etc. is damaging for Republican turnout, most notably his supporters which Loeffler and Perdue need to secure the Senate. Mondayâ€™s rally will either uplift Republican voters to get out and vote or deal the final blow to the party. Trump has even attacked both Republican candidates as well as other GA Republican State officials repeatedly for several issues from the stimulus checks to competence in handling the vote count amongst other things. Thereâ€™s speculation by a faction of Republicans that Trump is purposefully sabotaging the race, to send a message to Republicans that without him they are nothing.

Anyways keep an eye out. I think that if voter turnout can stay around 4m then Dems have a really good chance to pull this off. The more votes that come through on Election Day, the higher the chance for Republican control of the Senate.

Iâ€™m willing to take my chances here.

"E2open: Hugely undervalued AI/Cloud SaaS used by Microsoft, Google, AMD, Boeing, etc. Merging in early Q1",1609643326,mango1144,52,"In early Q1 P-C-P-L is merging with E2open. E2open has disruptive AI / Cloud technology for the supply-chain industry. They are widely used by big name customers including Google, Microsoft, Boeing, Walmart, Coca Cola, UPS, AMD, NVIDIA, Abbott, and dozens of others.

What differentiates them from other (more boring) supply chain management companies is the way they use AI to predict changes in supply and demand. Basically, E2open allows companies to see 10 steps ahead into the future to forecast how much inventory they will need based on hundreds of variables (geopolitics, resource availability, etc). This saves companies hundreds of millions in waste. CEO Michael Farlekas  compares it to working at a lemonade stand and being able to know ahead of time exactly how many lemons you will need. Obviously this will save you from wasting money on lemons that would spoil. E2open is the only company that integrates this type of AI technology with a vast data Cloud network.

E2open uses a subscription model to make consistent sustainable revenue from their 1000+ customers. There are multiple services they offfer, but over 50% of their customers only use 1 service. What's nice is that existing customers go on to utilize more and more of their services as they realize the value it adds to their companies. Google for example paid E2open twice as much over the course of 2 years. E2open makes additional revenue from new customers, and also by strategic value-adding acquisitions. The SPAC deal is allowing E2open to clean up their balance sheet so they can add value to their software portfolio (and charge higher premiums to existing customers) and continue making acquisitions.

E2open has been growing at a rapid clip since they were taken private in 2015. In 2015 they made $80M in revenue and in 2020 they made $335M. That's 420% growth in 5 years, or roughly +84% growth per year.

In the last 5 years they increased their revenue +420% by value-adding acquisitions they've made over the last decade --- Icon (2013), Serus Corp (2014), Terra Technology (2016), Orchestro (2016), Steelwedge (2017), Zyme (2017), Entomo and Birch Worldwide (2018), Inttra (2018), and Amber Road (2018) --- and integrating these different services to create a beautiful comprehensive end-to-end platform.

Somewhat surprisingly, their projections for 2021 are much lower at only +10% estimated revenue growth, which is the main reason most would argue P-C-P-L is trading so close to the NAV. However, 10% growth is actually really solid when you look at their margins and consider that 80% of their revenue is recurring with excellent customer retention. Institutional investors especially will appreciate E2open as the reliable revenue generating machine that it has  become. 

I'm also still optimistic about valuing E2open as a growth stock and feel the 10% is a low-ball estimate based on comparisons to the median growth of other supply chain management companies. I'm suspecting E2open will consistently  outperform expectations on a quarterly as the SPAC capital equips them to capitalize on their services, continue making acquisitions, and ultimately tap into millions in white space opportunity.

Even if E2open maintained a 10% growth rate  and if this were factored into its valuation, $11/share is still too damn low. E2open compares itself to Descartes, Kinaxis, Manhattan, and Spscommerce. With a median of 10.7x revenue, E2 was only at 7x, and with a median of 34.7x, E2 was only at 21.3x, meaning E2open has a much higher upside than its peers.

Institutions will bring the stock price up to par with it's peers and I believe the low ball projected growth is a conservative number that they will completely destroy when you consider their growth of +400% over the last 5 years. While 10% is perfectly fine for a company like E2open, I'm expecting the trend of the last 5 years to continue in 2021 and we'll be seeing some exciting numbers. 

My PT pre-merge is 15 and 25 EOY assuming their projected 10% revenue growth. If E2open surpasses 2021 expected revenue as I'm suspecting and they have major quarterly beats, I'm holding until 50.

Disclaimer: This is my largest position. I'm in 2500 shares at 10.87."

**A Value-Based A.I. Investment**  

&amp;#x200B;

In the era of growing small businesses and increasing brand presence, the internet appears to be a vast and difficult space to make a lasting impression on from a small business perspective. Small businesses may have insufficient entries in Google, Yahoo, and other search engines, where clients are likely to discover them. This is significant for these businesses, because if their information is inaccurate or missing, it will turn away potential customers. Yext, a growing New York based company under the ticker YEXT, provides a solution for modifying these entries and increasing the internet presence of small businesses.  YEXT shows promise as a growing long term stock due to its unique product line and hopeful financials.

In a sense, Yext is like Google but for enterprises that require more depth than Google can provide for them, and they actually use Google to help companies advertise and gain traction with consumer base using their APIs that are integrated with consumer platforms. The advertising industry is huge, as weâ€™ve seen Google, Facebook, and Snapchat dominate simply off reaching consumers, and collecting their data. Yext bridges the gap between businesses and unstructured data of potential consumers and existing consumers, setting them up in a multi-billion dollar industry expected to continually increase for the future. 

Their main product line includes Answers: a search engine, Listings: an advertising tool to get your companyâ€™s products onto multiple platforms, Pages: a tool that helps get your business at the top of every location search, Reviews: which helps you engage with customer feedback, and Knowledge Graph/Analytics which helps business owners see their customer interactions with their webpages and other online presence. Websites used to be everything for a business but now a business requires presence across multiple platforms and integration with every search engine, map, or social media. The more a businessâ€™ online presence is spread the more analytics you need too, and Yext is the amalgamation of the entire businessâ€™ internet presence. This cloud-based software is easy to use, and itâ€™s used by several reputable companies; including huge fast food chains, travel companies, car manufacturers and even banks. 

Yext solves the problem of particular consumer questions and connects the respective business with precisely what the consumer was looking for. Specific questions such as â€œwealth advisor near me who specializes in healthcareâ€ (an example they used in their past annual report) will become increasingly easier to answer with the newest developments in Artificial Intelligence. The control of the ever-changing facts of a business are what enable it to spread its sales. Up-to-date and relevant information on every nook and cranny of the web has become a necessity, as convenience has become the most necessary commodity. Poor site experience is a huge detractor for the large majority of shoppers, and if businesses are able to retain this potential loss in customers theyâ€™d be willing to pay anything. Managing an online presence using one dashboard is going to be a very desirable service for all businesses, regardless of size. Yext links all the chains together in the cloud, for Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri, and even the Chinese WeChat, all services which are improving more and more in terms of their search capabilities and theyâ€™re growing in popularity.

&amp;#x200B;

The product or service a company provides is the most crucial aspect of a companyâ€™s success, and YEXT seems to deliver on its product. The solution requires a subscription that can be priced according to a businessâ€™ specific needs. YEXT does not seem to have as many recognizable competitors. Its main competitors, Birdeye and Chatmeter, are both private companies with no real news about an IPO anytime soon, while YEXT has been public on the NYSE for three years. From this perspective, YEXT maintains an advantage over its competitors due to it being more recognizable and financially stronger due to its valuation reaching over a billion after going public. However, a reported issue with the product is that listings may go back to normal after a contract with a small business terminates. This is justifiable, because a small business could use the service for a month and reap all benefits. To improve this aspect of the solution that is controversial, maybe a potential solution could be negotiating a minimum period the contract has to be active in order for listings not to revert when it is terminated. Despite this drawback, Yext Inc. has innovated in this niche field and is emerging as a frontrunner in back-end listing modification.

Now that we have established that YEXT will likely be a frontrunner in structuring advertising data, we need to establish WHY this is a growing industry, as YEXT is heavily dependent on the growth of eCommerce and other forms of online and in person business. Without businesses, Yext will have no source of revenue so the expansion of commerce is critical to Yextâ€™s revenue. Fortunately, eCommerce and small businesses are trending upwards, indicating a healthy future for YEXT. One way to examine if this industry is growing is to analyze advertisement spending, as more online businesses directly correlates to more money spent on advertising. The graph below regarding digital advertising spending clearly illustrates that online business is growing, with advertisement spending nearly doubling over the six years.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/plzhvnh7w1961.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7bc511f13b8c4b13206acfc3015bfe9d5303176

Another way to gauge the health of the industry YEXT is heavily dependent on is to take a look at the growing amount of transactions online. Transactions correlate to greater revenue generated via the internet and thus a greater need for YEXT to introduce smaller businesses to this growing market. The chart below from Statista portrays the growth of Mobile POS payments and Digital commerce over seven years, almost tripling in total volume. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img jydysim9w1961...*

Once again this looks promising for YEXT, as their clients are primarily located in this sect of online business due to accurate data going hand in hand with more online sales. Furthermore, YEXT will be a solid pick for investors in the long term due to its growth along with a growing industry and its solid product. If you are interested in delving deeper into why eCommerce and online payments are growing, be sure to check out the Paypal/Square DD as well.

On their last 10k, Yext reported the following for their most recent compiled income statement:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f8renwobw1961.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d66290b3c437c25c5798b9130d55f3fdbbd25470

As you can see for the top line, there are plenty of positive signs. Revenue has grown by over $50M yearly from 2016 to 2019, and from 2019 to 2020 revenues grew by about $70M. So the indicator when it comes to sales is overwhelmingly signaling that this company is well-positioned to grow, especially in the near future. Gross profit margins are also great as the cost of the product itself isnâ€™t much. The potential issues in the income statement show up as you go toward the bottom line. Operating expenses far outweigh gross profits so net profits are -30% despite gross profit margins being 75%. Breaking down Opex, you can see that about â…” of them go towards sales and marketing, which isnâ€™t necessarily a bad thing as distributing your product can be a huge future investment, but it can be concerning for investors who want a product that â€œsells itselfâ€. Despite this rather arbitrary requirement, the sales growth justifies the spending as itâ€™s obviously working and eventually revenue should far outpace selling expenses. 

In their 10k, they state that their sales expenses primarily had to do with more wages and a higher headcount of employees. As the companyâ€™s operations grow, theyâ€™ll need more employees to run it in an aggressive growth stage. Despite the constant revenue growth, the stock price has been diluted due to more underwriting in 2019. It may take a while to recover from all the extra supply that was brought into the market, but even if we see more financing in early stages, I personally wouldnâ€™t be concerned as thatâ€™s a normal course of action for younger companies.

A quick look at the financials indicates that YEXT is improving as a company over each year. Due to their relatively high amounts of investment, the EPS for the company has remained negative. The EPS was also a lot worse in previous years. However, donâ€™t let this negative metric fool you, as the EPS has been trending positive since the first quarter of 2020. This indicates significant improvement, especially since the EPS hasnâ€™t been improving much prior to 2020. The increase of the EPS is also supported by the increase of change in working capital from $2M to $4M. As for the rest of the cash flow statement, the negative values are primarily caused by the expansion of operations. This expansion of operations is indicated by the increasing total assets, which means that YEXT grew their assets via larger operations. Although the numbers may be negative temporarily, the expansion of operations allows YEXT to generate more revenue from operations and hopefully turn the direction of cash flows around. Constant reinvestment back into the company is a good sign as it indicates owner and shareholder confidence in the future prospect.

Finally, delving into the 10Q provides reassuring prospects for the future health and growth of YEXT as a company. Looking at the breakdown of individual risks, YEXT looks to be relatively secure in the future. The main risks of the company are internal, and are not influenced by factors such as inflation and foreign currency fluctuations. To some, YEXT may appear risky due to its limited financial history and potential unprofitability due to it being relatively new. However, these risks will ultimately be insignificant, as the expansion of operations will soon be recovered by profits if YEXT maintains its current scale of growth that it has achieved in 2020.

In conclusion, YEXT will be a good pickup for many investors because the enterprise solutions industry overall has done very well, and Yextâ€™s solutions are definitely a foray into the future of artificial intelligence combined with traditional SaaS. If you compare Yext to another company that has a similar premise, Twilio, you can see that Yextâ€™s price/sales ratio is only 1/7th of Twilioâ€™s. Of course, Twilio is far more overvalued and has had better sales growth than Yext this past year, but Yext isnâ€™t a slouch in sales growth either as weâ€™ve seen. Plus, they have far more potential than Twilio does as weâ€™ve seen with their relatively small market cap of $2B. Both companies offer AI-based enterprise solutions, but Yext is just as good if not a better solution for the future as it has more applicability through a variety of businesses. If you want to see similar growth to what weâ€™ve seen in companyâ€™s such as Twilio but feel as if youâ€™ve missed the bus, donâ€™t worry: weâ€™ve got the pick for you. Yext is still 25% off its 52-wk high, and they are sure to surpass it with just one or two blowout positive ERs which will be in the books soon."

**Overview** 

Fluor is a Fortune 500 Engineering,Â Procurement and Construction (EPC)Â company headquartered in Irving Texas.Â  Fluor corporation has approximately 45,000 employees worldwide. The company operates in 6 segments, Energy and Chemicals, Mining and Industrial, Infrastructure and Power, Diversified Services, and Other with one additional segment being reported as discontinued operations. 

**Fundamental** **Problems** 

Fluor has multitude of issues that have threatened the very survival of the company. These issues have caused the market cap to crater from 8 Billion in 2018 to 2.25 Billion. The most critical problems are summarized below. This is by no means a complete list. For the sake of length, I have omitted some of the less critical issues. We must also note that there may also be other problems lurking as well. 

* Improper bidding, cost overruns and restructuring have led Fluor to report aÂ 1.5 Billion loss with approximately 300 Million in asset impairments. 
* There are 16 loss contracts that have been improperly negotiated and must be completed at zero margin. 
* Weakness in oil Demand has led Flours customers to reduce capex spending in the Energy &amp; Chemicals segment which comprises 40% of Fluorâ€™sÂ revenue. 
* Fluor has had major accounting problems which have spawned a SEC &amp; DOJ investigation. 

**Liquidity** 

Fluor has $2 Billion in cash, $5 Billion in current assets and $7.2 Billion in total assets. This compares to $3.5 Billion of current liabilities withÂ total liabilities of $6.0 Billion. I believe due to Fluorâ€™s strong cash position they have ample liquidity to meet all their near-term obligations. Furthermore, while substantial I believe their debt is withinÂ reasonable ranges. Fluor is selling an equipment rental business to allow them toÂ â€œModestlyâ€ reduce their leverage and raise more cash, further improving liquidity. 

**How Fluor Is Addressing Their Problems** 

While Fluorâ€™s issues are critical,Â I believe that management is successfully addressing these problems. 

Fluorâ€™s improper contract negotiation stems primarily from their Lump Sum contracts. Essentially this mean that Fluor gets paid in a lump sum at the project completion. This is problematic because it means Fluor must wait until completion of the project before being paid. Additionally, any cost overrun or delay is completely absorbed by Fluor. In order to prevent anymore loss contracts from entering their backlog Fluor has stopped negotiating lump sum contracts opting for more traditional contract negotiation approach and thus protecting the future backlog from more loss contracts. 

Despite a net loss of 1.5 Billion, Fluor has generated operating cash flow of $219 Million with Free Cash Flow of $38 Million. This operating cash flow will continue to give Fluor a buffer to complete their loss projects while even increasing their cash balance. As Fluor finishes these projects their operating cash flow and free cash flow will continue to climb higher.  

The weakness in revenue for Energy and Chemicals should also begin to slow as some EPC work for regular Maintenance is necessary to maintain oil and gas infrastructure. Furthermore,Â if emission standards become stricter this could spur demand as refineries increase CAPEX to upgrade their facilities. Finally, I expect the chemicals portion of this business to continue to drive adequate performance as we do not have any viable alternatives to Petro-Chemicals yet. 

On the accounting side Fluor has unfortunately discovered that there were problems with theirÂ Internal FinancialÂ Controls and revenue recognition. These issues have been corrected but I think it is safe to assume that Fluor has significant liability with potential SEC &amp; DOJ lawsuits.Â However,Â despite this I believe the lawsuits, while expensive, likely will take years to resolve and considering Fluorâ€™s strong cash position theyÂ will most likely will be able to pay the fine. 

**Impact of Reasonable Adverse Development's on Fluor's business** 

In order to establish Safety of principal we must consider a few possible adverse conditions that can arise and the impact on Fluor's business.Â  

* More loss contracts, This would be a very poor outcome for Fluor but I believe that even with more loss contracts Fluor would still generate enough cash to meet all theirÂ obligations. in a worst case scenario Management could also continue to sell more assets in order to raise more capital to fund the loss contracts. 
* Major Global Economic Recession, This would be mostly bad for Fluor but its possible they could actually benefit from fiscal stimulus and projects designed to spur demand in the Economy.  They also have a backlog of projects so a major drop in revenue wouldn't immediately occur in a recession. Rather they would have a little bit of time to figure out what to do.
* Prolonged Depressed Oil Prices, This is a pretty likely scenario thankfully Fluor has expertise in many different industries and can continue to drive growth in these areas. WhileÂ over exposed at the moment they are not solely dependent on Oil and Gas. 

**Major Growth Opportunities** 

These ideas below are the most exciting and compelling reason to look at investing in Fluor. 

Fluorâ€™s Mining &amp; Industrial segment constructs &amp; maintains mines globally. As demand for precious metals increase due to a transition away from fossil fuels, precious metals for batteries could take the place of Oil. This includes lithium, nickel and cobalt Fluor has prior experience with these materials. Mining already comprises about 35% of their revenue and has been profitable and a major pillar of stability in Fluor's business. (Although Covid has Delayed some new contract awards in this segment)

Fluorâ€™s Energy &amp; Chemicals Business has built off shore wind farms, carbon capture, bio-fuels and hydrogen infrastructure. All infrastructure currently being looked at to mitigate or solve the climate change crisis. This area will be competitive but Fluor does have its own IP it can bring to the table and compete with. If there is a major jump in demand in the coming years Fluor is certainly capable of winning some construction work in these areas.

Some other miscellaneous things Fluor engages in is nuclear decommissioning, managing the U.S strategic oil reserve, Building automobile &amp; Pharmaceutical factories and Data center construction. 

And then there is the crown jewelÂ NuScale, a company planning on building the First small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) in the United States. Fluor is the Majority investor in NuScale and is the exclusive EPC contractor for NuScale. Recently the U.S Nuclear Regulatory Commission certified NuScaleâ€™s one-of-a-kind design. The U.S Department of Energy has also awarded NuScaleâ€™sÂ first customer $1.3 Billion in cost sharing to build the first reactor Idaho. Interestingly the United States International Development Finance Corp also lifted a ban for the financing of nuclear projects and has also signed a letter of intent to support NuScale. This will likely be a $1 Billion dollar loan South Africa in order to build a NuScale SMR . There are many other interested parties both inside and outside the U.S including Canada, Romania and the Czech Republic. The applications of this technology are wide ranging. Electricity production is a primary use, however other uses include desalination for clean drinking water and using the excess heat produced by the reactor to create cheap carbon free hydrogen. 

**Basis for Investment** 

In the near term I believe Fluor can successfully complete a turnaround restoring most of their business segments back to reasonable profitability. In 2017 Fluor generated 318 Million in Free Cash Flow. Assuming Fluor completes their restructuring and finishes the loss contracts I see no reason why Fluor cannot return to at least 250 million in annual free cash flow. This FCF is 11% of Fluor's Total market cap and by itself presents a very attractive return for an investor. Simultaneously Fluorâ€™s should be able to shift their construction focus away from oil and gas to newÂ areas that are growing increasingly important. The low barriers to entry are both a blessing and curse in this regard. That brings me to NuScale which oddly seems as though itâ€™s being adopted by the U.S government as some strange foreign policy play. While it remains a longshot in my view the combination of the DOE grant and the potential DFC loan is 2.3 billion a big positive. This is equivalent to the entire market cap of Fluor and shows the scale of the opportunity. Furthermore, Fluor currently has no competitors in this market so margins should be significantly higher. I believe Fluor will complete a successful turnaround likely bringing the stock back to 4 Billion and restoring the dividend. In the Long-term the company could even hit new all-time highs however Iâ€™m not entirely confident on putting an exact figure on that just yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Fluor is struggling construction company, but I think the company can pull off a successful turnaround. That coupled with expanding their existing non-oil revenue and the NuScale wild card could send the stock from $16 to at least $30 and possibly beyond $80 (its all time high) since its a very compelling growth story. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also sorry if there's a lot of awkward phrasing or poor grammar I have a learning disability lol. (actually though)

"Why lame things like ""This is not investment advice"" need to be added to every post for the safety of this sub.",1609655964,nafizzaki,14,"1.You gotta admit it. This sub is probably the most influential subreddit. Yet, itâ€™s linguistic conventions are not really Reddit's most proud achievement. 

2. Also, thereâ€™s always some pumpers trying their best.

3. Traditional media outlets are also noticing the sub.

In this scenario, think of yourself as some scrupulous individual, you can PROBABLY sue reddit in one way or another. Or even if you cannot sue, reddit employees themselves could be nervous about what sort of things could blow up in this sub(like we all are trying to force a squeeze in something).

Think of Se eking A lpha getting banned from reddit for one reason or another.

What I am getting at is that Reddit can ban this sub using some lame duck excuses and that would be terrible.

So, it would be best to say something like, ""This is not investment advice. You are truly retarded if you don't do your own research before investing your own money. Past performance........."" whenever someone suggests a play.

I know this could be difficult to follow, but I would say this would be a necessary evil."

&amp;#x200B;

2 days ago while most of us were constantly checking RH even though markets were closed, [Microsoft got hacked.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/31/tech/microsoft-source-code/index.html) These are the same hackers that hacked Solarwinds. It became known a couple weeks ago Did you see what happened to SWI recently? Go check. Down almost 40%.  Now look, I'm no genius, but if Solarwinds got hacked and dropped more than 1/3rd, Microsoft probably isnt gonna be sitting super peachy, is it? To be fair, Microsoft said that only Source Code was viewed, but Solarwinds is literally an IT company based around management and IT Security, and it took months for them to figure out they were hacked. My guess is it's much worse than it sounds, be prepared for a big microsoft dip.

Are stocks overpriced? How much growth is required to justify a P/E of 100?,1609666390,Shayco,6,"In this post, we shall explore how the one- and two-stage Gordon Growth Models, and Dividend Discount Model, relate to growth rates, valuations, earnings, dividends, inflation, and return on investment.

Let E = earnings d = dividend P = price r = discount rate g = (terminal) dividend growth rate

Then y = d/P is the dividend yield Y = E/P is the earnings yield P/E = 1/Y p = d/E is dividend payout ratio

According to the Gordon Growth Model,

y = d/P = r - g.

Hence,

Y = y/p.

So, for example, if r = 10% is the required return, and the growth rate is g = 3%, then dividend yield should be y = 7%.

If also the payout ratio is 70%, then the P/E must be 10. If the payout ratio is p = 100%, then the P/E can be ~14.

It may appear counter-intuitive that higher retention requires a lower P/E. But remember that we are talking about dividend growth rates, g, not earnings growth rates.

So if a firm is able to grow dividends without retaining earnings, this likely means that it benefits from pricing power, protecting from inflation, or that it has conservative accounting.

However, when the dividend is zero, g cannot be measured, and the model breaks down.

So we assume that earnings represent distributable cash, in the sense that if the dividend payout were 100%, the business could sustain constant earnings. And then we consider the situation where a fast-growing company wishes to retain all of its earnings for future growth. However, indefinite growth at a rate higher than the nominal GDP is implausible. And indefinite growth without dividends is, in theory, not worth anything. To be valuable, a company must eventually harvest earnings. Or it must be acquired, and its survivor must harvest earnings. So, consider the situation where a company grows quickly for a period of time and then grows more slowly while paying dividends. For this, we may apply a two-stage Gordon Growth Model, which is really just a special case of the Dividend Discount Model (DDM). For simplicity, assume the initial growth is g, and the payout ratio is zero, for a period of n years, prior to slowing to a (dividend and earnings) terminal growth rate h, and a 100% payout ratio, with dividend d.

The correct price after n years is given by the Gordon Growth Model:

P_n = d / (r - h).

But in order for this price to be achieved in n years, the price today must be,

P_n = d_n / [(r - h) (1 + r)n].

At time n, d_n = E_n, which will have grown:

E_n = E (1 + g)n.

Hence,

P = E (1 + g)n / [(r - h) (1 + r)n]

= [(1 + g) / (1 + r)]n * E / (r - h).

Rearranging, we find,

g = [(1 + r) * [(r - h) (P/E)]1/n - 1] * 100%

Assume, for example, if the discount rate (required return) is r = 10%, and the initial P/E is 100.

If the terminal growth rate is h = 0 after n = 10 years, then the required earnings growth spurt for these 10 years will be g = 38.5% per annum, for a 26-fold increase in earnings. But, after all, r = 10% is a nominal discount rate, a mature company may be expected to grow at a rate of

h = i + G,

where i = inflation rate and G = real GDP growth rate.

So if i = 3% and G = 2%, then, h = 5% may be expected at maturity, with a 100% dividend payout policy.

Reviewing the formula, then, we find the following results for different periods of growth, n, where g = growth rate, and m = E_n / E, the factor by which earnings multiply:

n = 10 years g = 29.2% m = 13 times

n = 15 years g = 22.5% m = 21 times

n = 20 years g = 19.2% m = 34 times

We see then, that a business must sustain approximately 20% earnings growth for 20 years in order for it to justify a current P/E of 100, assuming it matures at year 20. A higher hurdle rate, r, would require more aggressive assumptions about growth, and a lower hurdle rate would require less aggressive growth assumptions. Naturally, growth rates of high-growth companies tend to fall continuously, with size (law of large numbers) and competition. But this is a rough illustration of what is required. One may experiment with the formula using other P/E ratios, etc. Also, the formula does not directly apply to loss-making companies. And, in fact, some loss-making companies can become profitable and grow earnings quickly via operating leverage. $FB is one such example. When it IPO'd in 2012, it was barely profitable. However, it subsequently grew earnings one thousandfold, because revenues rose faster than costs.

Growth rates in the above examples are rare, so forecasting them should be rather difficult."

I grew up spending much of my teenage years in their stores. In fact, I was born in raised in Grapevine, Tx, where they started. But now youâ€™re talking about one of the most poorly managed companies I can think of. GameStop had every opportunity to transition to online sales and theyâ€™ve blown it every step of the way. They have been slowly closing retail stores for years, but itâ€™s been a slow bleeding death. They should have gone all in to online sales years ago. They had the capital and the customer base to pull it off for years and theyâ€™ve done nothing to capitalize on it. They are still committed to trying to make retail stores work and itâ€™s a dying medium. They are the Playboy of porn. Yes, they will probably continue to live out a meager existence for some years, but the idea that they will get back to the top is ludicrous. They are dinosaurs going extinct. Even today as they close a thousand stores, their online marketplace is garbage. I canâ€™t think of the last time Iâ€™ve seen a worse web page from a major company. They are too little, too late with their change in management and the other digital market places have taken a firm foothold as their leaders."

Why did PLTR sell off last week? (An analysis),1609679388,notlikethis1994,153,"\# Everybody that wanted in, was already in

According to finviz.com, retail investors own 79% of PLTR's float (shares available for trading), suggesting that much of the price increase from $10 to over $30 in the past 3 months was driven by said class of investors. It's unlikely that risk-sensitive institutions would be heavily involved in such a feverish stock. For example, Palantir's market cap increased by more than $10 billion in a couple days after the announcement of a $44 million 3-year partnership with the FDA. $44 million over 3 years is a rounding error relative to its annual revenue.

After hitting its $33 peak, PLTR pulled back and consolidated at a $25 to $29 price range. During this time, people continue to be bullish for the stock with many believing that it'll soon break all-time-highs again. Unfortunately, at least in the short term, everyone that wanted in was already in and the lack of new buying primed the stock for a sell-off. Another way to spot this is when /r/WallStreetBets starts being filled with bullish commentary for the stock. On a few days in November and December, the majority of the subreddit was talking about PLTR. If you think about it, users would only create a bullish post or upvote bullish posts of a stock if they already had a long position.

Once the buying pressure waned, a small amount of selling compounded with other bearish factors discussed below were sufficient to trigger large waves of selling.

\# Options market makers selling hedged stocks for sold calls

Options market makers are institutions contracted by an exchange to supply liquidity to the options market, even when there's no willing external buyer or seller. Market makers make money by buying or selling options to traders at slightly worse prices than the actual price, and pocketing the difference. As such, they aren't interested in making a directional bet on a stock's price by being short or long options and whenever you sell or buy an option from them, they need to hedge their position.

Specifically, when a market maker sells a call option to a trader, the market maker needs to hedge by buying the underlying stock. When a market maker buys a call option from a trader, the market maker shorts the underlying stock. Vice versa for puts.

PLTR had a large number of open call positions expiring at year-end. As price fell, most of these options expired worthless and the market makers that sold them had to unwind their hedges. Because market makers buy the underlying stock to hedge against a sold call position, they sell said stock when unwinding the hedge. As large numbers of PLTR's call options expired worthless at year-end, options market makers sold the PLTR they bought as a hedge which contributed to the year-end price decline.

\# Institutional funds rebalancing

Even though retail investors own most of Palantir's tradeable shares, institutions do own a non-trivial amount (12% of the float, according to finviz.com) that were mostly acquired during the IPO. These institutions include Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, and Soros Fund Management. Funds have a target ownership percentage for each portfolio stock and when its price increases or decreases dramatically in a short period, the fund needs to rebalance by selling or buying said stock. Rebalancing happens either at a fixed time period or when an imbalance threshold is crossed. Because PLTR's price appreciated so rapidly in just a couple months, it probably fell victim to year-end institutional rebalancing.

\# Frontrunning profit-taking in 2021

Because PLTR's price increased so rapidly in 2020, traders are expected to sell in 2021 to defer taxes for one year. It's likely that some traders attempted to get ahead of this expectation by selling a few days before December 30th (trades executed on and after this date settle in 2021). PLTR's price started to fall off a cliff on December 28th and it kept falling until the year's last trading day on December 31st. As such, the selling on the 28th and 29th is partially attributed to traders frontrunning new-year-profit-taking while the selling on the 30th and 31st is new-year-profit-taking.

\# Frontrunning the 2021 lock-up period expiry

Palantir's IPO was a direct listing meaning that it only made existing shares sellable on the market. No new shares were created and sold. This means that insiders (founders, employees, and VCs) own most of Palantir's shares. During the IPO, these insiders could only sell 20% of their holdings and the other 80% are locked up until after 2021's first earnings report. Unsurprisingly, traders expect more selling than usual when these shares unlock since 80% is a lot of shares. Long time PLTR holders will want to divest at least some of their holdings. It's plausible that, like new-year-profit-taking, traders are selling early to get ahead of the lock-up period ending.

\# Price chart sell signals

Technical analysis (using price charts to determine when to buy or sell) is controversial but still popularly used to predict short term price movements. PLTR's chart displayed several sell signals ever since it peaked at $33. For one, the chart has a giant double top with rejections at $33 and $31 on November 27th and December 8th respectively. A double top is a very popular sell signal. Bullish momentum and volume has also waned since the price peak with daily MACD (a technical indicator) becoming bearish on December 10th. Falling momentum is no bueno for a stock driven by momentum.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img gzt5snrgx4961...*

For the latest swing we have broken above the previous high at 19 and held and has reacted to the 150% extension line. We now know that the institutions and the algos are working off this swing structure. Their target will be in the upper red box around $29- $30.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 8myexzhgy4961...*

Ideally the best place to buy would be in the green box around $19 however if we do a statistical arbitrage analysis of the stock vs the price of steel, I dont think it will go back this far.

This is a chart of MT vs Steel Futures prices. You can see the stock has a close correlation to steel prices and is trading at a significant discount to the price of steel. The last steel price peak of $900 , MT was trading at an average of $30( purple box area). Steel is now at $1000, so the $30 target is very reasonable.

*Processing img 22msxzrgz4961...*

From current price to $30 is a 30% gain for an initial target. It could blow through this area but I would expect to see some profit taking here and a short term reversal especially if steel prices start to come off. If they dont the institutions will re accumulate for the next leg up. 

I will look to buy at 22.20, 21.20 and around 19 if I see the right volumes coming in."

"Recovery Rebate Credit: If you were claimed as a dependent but paid taxes, you may be still be able to claim $1,200 on your taxes this year.",1609691733,wcamerons,55,"**Good Morning Yâ€™all.**

The other day I was reading the news and saw [this](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wzzm13.com/amp/article/money/first-stimulus-payment-tax-claim/67-c48b059f-0457-4abe-b00d-3748a01cdf1f). Thereâ€™s no rocket or moon emojis so I know none of you will read it. But hereâ€™s the main point:

*â€If a college student worked in 2020 they're still eligible,"" said Greene-Lewis. If the student files their taxes independently for 2020, they can use the Recovery Rebate Credit to get up to $1,200.

Most students are also not eligible for the second stimulus check, so they can also use the credit next year to get $600.â€*

Many of you guys, like me, are claimed as a dependent by your parentsâ€”even if youâ€™re basically living on your own as a college student and file your taxes independently. This meant that when stimulus checks were sent out, you didnâ€™t receive the $1,200 you so desperately wanted to throw at TSLA weeklies. **Thereâ€™s a way that you can get what you deserve.**

The Rebate Recovery credit is a tax credit that 18-24 year old dependents can claim when they file their taxes to get up to $1,200. Remember this when you file this tax season. And, yaâ€™ know, get back at Mitch a little.

Along with the $3,000 in losses youâ€™re gonna claim anyways, you can now also claim the stimmy money this tax season. Now, you wonâ€™t be able to pay back that loan your dad gave you; but, throw your tax refund into enough GME calls, and you may be able to return your account to even.

Can you tell when I started and stopped taking WSB seriously,1609692646,Anoose007,0,
A Cry for Help,1609692662,Hun-chan,8," About five years ago a friend of mine recommended the intelligent investor by Benjamin Graham. The strategy outlined within really resonated with me. I spent my twenties as wandering acetic of sorts, and I never imagined myself playing the stock market, because it seemed like the kind of endeavor reserved for guys who snort blow off of hookerâ€™s tits in the back of lambos. Value investing, on the other hand, seemed to really fit my persona. I mean Iâ€™m the kind of guy who will argue with the green grocer for hours just to get a 10-cent discount on some shriveled turnip, so I figured I might actually have a knack for sniffing out bargains in the equity markets as well. I became more and more eager to dip my toes into stocks, so over the next few years I devoured every bit of literature I could find on the subject, mostly focusing on the works of the greats like Warren Buffet and Ray Dalio, etc. Iâ€™d already been investing in index funds for about 10 years or so, but in July of 2020, I felt like I was finally ready to take the plunge, so I registered for an account with Fidelity and after much consideration I loaded up what I believed to be a pretty-well balanced portfolio that could potentially grow my trifling savings and supplement my paltry income as a freelance translator.   

Fast forward to the present and Iâ€™ve lost about 30% of my initial investment. Thatâ€™s mostly on stonks mind you, because my pee-pee is much too small to bear the weight of leverage and options. I have found that I possess an uncanny ability to buy the peaks and sell the dips. Iâ€™ve done it multiple times over with all manner of stocks. I firmly seize the reigns when they soar to their lofty heights and then ride them down to their absolute troughs, clinging in utter paralysis until queasiness overcomes me and I seek relief by clicking the sell button.

Truth be told, I have also begun dabbling with some contracts here and there. Though I always try to play it safe, sticking to two months out ATM calls, but somehow every time, within moments of clicking the buy button, the trend lines belligerently reverse, as if to spite me. At this point I am 0 for 10 with my options trades. I have never made money â€“ Not. One. Single. Time. 

Allow me to recount one of my most agonizing trades. My misstep involved a company by the name of Sportsmanâ€™s Warehouse. I noticed it was a major holding of Scion Asset Management hand-picked by the OG autist himself Dr. Michael Burry. In mid-October it was trading at about $13/share, giving it a single-digit P/E ratio, amidst peers with valuations nearly double that. The company had reported impressive revenue growth the previous quarter, but much of that income came from bubba wingnuts preemptively scooping up semi-automatic weapons before Paw Biden got a chance to slap a ban on the AR-15. My thesis was that the share price was being punished unduly, and that their diverse revenue streams would buoy the share price in due time. I bought some $13 calls expiring on December 18. I watched over the next two months as the share price continued its jagged downward trajectory and my calls expired worthless. 

â€œThen what happened?â€ 

Well, Iâ€™m glad you asked because, the very next trading day Sportsmanâ€™s Warehouse announces that it will be acquired by Bass Pro, and then, as if to mock me, the chart produced a handsome green fully engorged candlestick about 40% taller than my strike price.

On another occasion I followed a hot tip on WSB and bought ATM calls on Atlas Air Worldwide about a week before Congress requested that they to return 630 million dollars granted to them as part of the Payroll Support Program, and the share price tanked. 

I was also intrigued by BMC Holdings, a home builder with an ingenious system of flat-pack framing that saved contractors money in labor costs and disposal fees. True to form I rode that one sideways for a few weeks, eventually got bored, and sold it to break even, only to see it moon days later on news of acquisition by a larger rival. 

Perhaps the most tragic blunder in my short stint as a trader concerns our beloved GME. I first learned of the GME deep value proposition on this sub in July, and I watched timidly from the sidelines until the share price was sufficiently elevated for my entry. This was probably the closest thing I had ever done to a YOLO. I bought $8,000 worth of shares in late September for 10.98 and held steadfast until October 8 by which time it had declined almost 20%. At about 12:30 pm on that fateful day I decided to cut my losses to the sum of $1,600, cursing the name of the WSB autist who had led me into this ill-conceived trade. I could almost feel the sulci furrowing into my smooth brain as I made up my mind to click the sell button. Henceforth, I would think for myself. Never again would I be led astray by â€œstock tipsâ€ from strangers on the internet, be they the incoherent ravings of a WSB degenerate or the prudent advice of a WSJ sage. I summoned up my reserves of discipline, stood up, and walked away from the trading desk. Well, I suppose we all know what happened about an hour and a half later. GME achieved lift off, propelled by news of the Microsoft partnership and I was left admiring its celestial flight from my decidedly terrestrial vantage point. 

The other day I decided to do a little back-testing, thinking that it might provide some insight into what I have been doing wrong. I plugged in all of the tickers from the portfolio I picked back on day 1 and I found that if I had simply diamond-handed those bitches I would be up like over 100% within the past 6 months. That first day of my foray into investing I had the good sense to buy stuff like NIO, BILI, AMD, and BMCH, and I had every intention of holding them forever, but then I found this sub and decided to try some more â€œadvancedâ€ strategies.

Now I scan my watchlist and notice how every single ticker has just kept bouncing along higher and higher. It seems, so inconceivable that my account balance has followed the opposite trajectory. How could this happen? What went wrong? I managed to lose money buying stocks in one of the biggest bull markets in history. My timing was so impeccable. I was somehow able to enter even stocks with tremendous upward momentum and exit just after a major correction. I am a true prodigy at buying high and selling low. It occurs to me (as it must to all shitty traders) that if I had simply taken a short position on all of those trades, I would have actually tucked away a 30% gain. Have I just been fooling myself into feigned bullishness all along? Was I born to be a bear?

$PETS petmed express undervalued if you believe the business will persevere!,1609693690,ArcticGold,6,"I'm not even sure I'm allowed to post this just simply due to the fact it's not a 1B market cap.

Pros: It sells pets meds since two decades ago. No long term debt  $100+ million in cash. Gives out like $1.00+ in dividend/year.

Market cap is 650M simply because ppl no longer think there's future potential.

PETS is holding pretty well by itself but probably better if some big mamba can acquire it whole.

It has the licenses to send drugs all over the US and Canada.

Cons: Chewy started off their own pet pharmacy in 2018.
Walmart and Amazon kinda did as well. Chewy is still losing money but wallstreet is pricing them as a strong growth company. Not sure why Chewy didn't just spent $1 billion and incorporated petmed express in 2018.

1800-petmeds website looks like a website in the 1990's.

Short story: good undervalued stock that gives a dividend. Hopefully Amazon would throw their 2 pennies at it and just acquire petmed express. Easy to enter the pet market with a good track record and petmed express wouldn't need to use their crappy website anymore."

Lessons from 2020,1609696262,_WinnerTakesAll_,33,"Hi All, 

I debated if I should make this post but I thought it might help one or two new kids who are new to investing. If you think it's useless down vote it and I will delete it. 

At the beginning of 2020 I  was just like most of you was not a member of WSBs and invested on my own accord. All that changed in February. I opened an active trading account for fun. I joined reddit and figured I should get involved with the community so that we make money together. Here are the lessons that I think would help some of newer guys than me. Also here is my performance in my speculative account which was opened in March 2020:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w762xt6805961.png?width=890&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f227bc450c381543cb098dd12cfeb3f1f1a1aebd

**Lesson 1: Consistency Matters**

My goal with this speculative account was to try different strategies but get consistent returns nonetheless. I aimed to not have any down months. This helps alleviate the mental anguish caused by roller-coaster-type portfolios. As my mama told me 5 years ago, you are playing with hard-earned-money. This is why I stayed away from YOLOing the whole account on few select plays. I aimed to have many different bets going on at the same time. 

**Lesson 2: Helping others is harder than earning money.**

My dad opened a speculation account at the same in March. I decided that I would help him have a similar performance as mine. I kept on feeding him info about my trades. What did he do? Most of the times he thought I was retarded and called the local hospital for me. When Boeing dropped to $93, I was on the phone telling him this is free money. I told him to by $30k but he just bought $10k. I was buying American Airlines on the same day. This story repeated many times over the last 9 month. I think at the end he managed to scratch of \~250%. Now I have him on a conservative buy and hold strategy since he is not cut out to actively trade. And by actively I mean 4 trades a week for him. 

**Lesson 3: Having a good broker is important**

If you haven't deleted Robinhood and gotten your self a proper broker after you hearing or experiencing bugs, crashes, service outages, your data being sold, .... then I don't know if I can convince you. Other brokers will give you access to ADRs and allow you invest in some bigger European companies that are trading OTC here. 

**Lesson 4: Don't argue with people; instead discuss ideas.**

If you notice someone is arguing instead of discussing ideas with you then just ignore them. For every seller of a stock there is a buyer. There is no point in personally attacking people. If you believe strongly that they are wrong, then just inverse their trade. Respect and thank them for sharing their trades with you, even if you disagree with them.

**Lesson 5: Media is a hype machine**

CNBC, Bloomberg, ... are all in the business of creating excitement and increasing their viewership. They are not there to enhance your returns. What gets people's attention is usually not a good investment. 

**Lesson 6: Reddit slaps you harder than a twisted tea**

I used to share ALL my DDs here. Sharing is caring, right? apparently not. There was no shortage of personal attacks, being banned, DDs being deleted, ... My Karma even dropped to -1k in March. I am permanently banned from r/ investing, economics, .... I got temporary banned here, and two other investing subs. So I post less DDs now, and don't try to stop people from jumping from rooftops. 

**Lesson 7: Most popular posts/users should not be blindly mimicked**

Most people including me already know this, but I keep seeing it here. I figured I should mention it since I have your attention. When you see a trade that is getting a lot of attention ask yourself: does this fit my strategy? If not then don't do it. What is strategy you ask? oh boy

**Lesson 8: Don't let survivor bias fool you**

Everyday people on WSB are throwing millions of dollars on thousands of small bets. The odds are some of them are gonna pay of. So when you see some guy posting Gain-porn of 1k turning to 100k overnight. Remember that over night thousands of other people with similar bets lost it all. So don't just follow people blindly. Some of the most respected guys here are essentially doing the same thing by YOLOing all their money on one bet that unfolds over several month. These guys last longer but essentially are playing few bets game. When you roll the dice 5 times the odds of you getting 5 in a row is a lot. There is a reason we don't hear from YungBillionaire anymore. Please don't Yolo your whole account on GME, Palantir, and such. 

**Lesson 9: Moderation on reddit is skewing the information you see**

It's hard to be an unpaid moderator on reddit. So more power to them. I have to say u/zjz is one of the best I've seen.... When a post has to clear the personal point of view of 10 moderators on each sub, you end up with what in the industry is known as committee results; ie neutered and already priced in. Usually 1/3 of my posts make it through the mod filter so I am posting less and less every day. Sometimes I discuss a post with a mod and make it acceptable to him and then another one comes and bans me for 3 days for a DD with 90% upvote. lol

**Lesson 10: When the tide goes out you realize who was swimming naked.**  

Popularized by WB, he wasn't the one who came up with it. When a correction happens, and I guarantee you there will be a correction, then you realize who was blindly chasing alpha without any risk management. The correction may not come for a few years but there always is a correction, pullback for some random reason. So **manage your risk.** Guh

**Lesson 11: unless you have insider info do not buy weekly or even monthly options.**

LEAPs are risky as well but can be managed. Most people here should not take the weekly or monthly option risk. You need years of experience before doing so. 

**Lesson 12: Paper accounts don't count.**

You need real money to be at risk so that you care and go through the emotions. I never had a paper account and if you are using one, in my opinion you are wasting your time. 

**Lesson 13: No one has a magic sauce.** 

Those who pretend to do are delusional. There is no such thing as ""always do this and you will win"". Market changes and strategies that work now will not work in 2 month. If a guru says buy x, y and z and you will make money, that's total BS.  

**Lesson 14: If you get money help yourself and your family**

You have the option Yoloing your money on weeklys, buy coke, or elevating your life. Money truly brings happiness. Only people who don't have it think that it does not; and site a bs study. Use your money to help your family at key points in their lives. Help with their Mortgage down payment, buy a car for the ones who really need them,... Use your money to work less and work out more. Yolo in real life, not on options. 

**Lesson 15: If you don't invest with conviction, you won't get the results that matter**

You have to know why you are buying some stock and why you would sell it. A lot of winning trades will go against you before they go green. To hold those positions when deep in the red, you gotta have conviction in your thesis. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not going to edit this post because it will mess up it's format. I am going to put a comment below with updates/corrections. Also do NOT message me personally. I don't have a magic sauce."

*Profitability*

Price to sales is high, coming in at 15.63. Compared to some of their competitors (listed below), the average for the industry is below 2. Said differently, investors are paying a high premium for the rapid growth in revenue and the hope that the industry will explode someday. The key questions are will the AI industry expand and how much of this market will be funneled into Palantir, both commercially and from the government. 

Their revenue is growing quickly. Over the past year it has grown 21.27% and over the prior three years it has a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.83%.

Cash flow and net income are both negative, but they are improving. Their net income has increased by 20% over the past year and their free cash flow has increased by 64.41%. 

Net profit margins are also still negative, but increased 32.63% over the prior year. One thing about their margins is that they definitely live a lavish life style at their workplace. The food is free, the equipment is expensive, and the amenities are abundantâ€”having observed this, they absolutely attract some of the best employees around. 

A nice segway into the balance sheet is to talk about their accounts receivable (A/R). Their ability to collect money consistently and accurately are impressive, with only $5 million in A/R for this year and only $2 million in A/R last year. 

*Balance Sheet*

The company has a book value of $791.47 million and sells at a P/B of ~21.10. This is high for a traditional value or growth play, but is not absurd for technology companies.

Their current and quick ratio are 2.78 and 2.65, respectively. This is impressiveâ€”for safety, a rule of thumb I use is a current ratio above 1.5 and a quick ratio above 1. Anything over 2 ensures a high probability of survival during difficult times. Also, the company barely has any money tied up in restricted cash, allowing them to allocate money to working capital more easily and preventing liquidity crises. But it is not as rosy as it seems. I will talk about the preferred securities shortly. 

The company has $1.08 billion in short-term cash and cash equivalents. Their short-term (&gt; 1 year) liabilities are $730 million and their total liabilities are $3.57 billion. The D/E ratio is impressive, hovering around .39. The larger contractors usually have a D/E ratio above 1-1.5, with the exception of Raytheon. 

One thing that is not shown in the D/E ratio is something I mentioned in a prior paragraph, the preferred stock. This is a problem because preferred shares act very similar to debt. They currently have $2.13 billion in preferred shares outstanding, and I am not sure how many of those are convertible. If we add that to the debt, their new D/E ratio is over 2, putting it higher than most defense contractors. 

*Compensation / Dilution*

Currently, the company has $1.6 billion shares outstanding from their direct listing. On top of that, they have approximately 2.17 billion diluted shares. Said differently, if all options and convertible securities are activated, that is the potential number of shares outstanding. For any company this is an extreme amount of dilution and something Warren Buffet warns value investors about. The engineers and executives are highly compensated through their 250 million+ stock option program, as well as the preferred security holders. 

*Insider Selling*

One thing we never like to see is insider selling. The CEO has sold 11% of his stake, or 14.1 million shares, for $135 million. Cofounder Peter Thiel sold even more, ~$365 million. Nonetheless, the CEO still has the majority of his holdings and will be issued more stock if the company reaches goals in the future. This is something I am not too excited about, but it is not a major red flag because it was a small amount and perhaps he just wanted some cashâ€”he has been working hard for 17 years awaiting this day. 

*Competitors*

When it comes to direct competitors (contractors that specialize in AI), it appears that Leidos, Raytheon, and FireEye stand out the most. However, looking at the defense contracting industry as a whole, Lockheed, Boeing, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman also present threats. Interestingly, there are arguments online that Palantir is extra risky because ~half of their revenue comes from US Government contracts, but this is a common characteristic for many of the defense contractors that I listed above, even Boeing. 

*Valuation*

I will base my valuation on them staying negative cash flow in the coming three years then netting X amount of cash flow for a few scenarios. I can send you the excel document if you want. I will summarize below. My discount rate is 8% (which is high, but conservative) and my growth rate is 7% (which is also somewhat optimistic). 

When it comes to cash flow, I have estimated they will stay negative for three years then slowly work up to $100 million. I will assign different values to their perpetual cash flow after 10 years below keeping the growth rate and discount rate the same. Two major things can happen to mess up the calculations. The growth rate could be higher or lower and the amount of cash flow could be higher or lower.  

Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $100 million annually: $10.9 billion
Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $150 million annually: $16.263 billion
Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $200 million annually: $21.613 billion
Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $250 million annually: $26.963 billion
Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $300 million annually: $32.213 billion
Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in $350 million annually: $37.663 billion

Itâ€™s difficult to value a company that is in such an early stage based off cash flow. We have no idea how much cash flow they will bring in, how much the industry will grow, or where interest rates will be. Nonetheless, doing this analysis is sobering and dampens expectations. 

*Other Topics*

Their recruiting and the quality of engineers and computer scientists are similar to that of Tesla. People in the industry know this is a difficult company to work for. Their interviewing process is unique and difficult, usually encompassing a difficult task using their software (i.e. here is a bunch of data; find the terrorist using Gotham). 

Another interesting thing to look at is a top-down, or macro, approach to the industry. 

Here are some interesting points:
1. The US military budget is ~$689.6 billion, and this will likely increase or stay the same in the future
2. AI accounted for ~$4 billion of this budget
3. Cyber security accounted for ~$9.85 billion 
4. Palantir receives approximately half their revenue from government contracts, which is ~$500 million

Letâ€™s assume that the combined budget for AI and cybersecurity grows to $20 billion ($5 billion higher than it is now) in the future, which I think is reasonable. If Palantir is one of the leaders in this industry and accumulate 5% of that $20 billion budget, that would be $1 billion from government contracts, not including their fast growth in the commercial industry. These numbers are conservative, as I think the allocation for AI and cyber could be closer to $50-$100 billion someday. This is where the opportunity is and the commercial side is just icing on the cake. 

If Palantir becomes the leader and the world trends more to cybersecurity and AI, there is potential to make money. 

Finally, I would like to speak about my personal experience with the company. I have used many intelligence tools, but only two stand out to me. Palantir is one of them and it is a cut above its peers. The beauty, capability, and analysis tools are unmatched. It is user-friendly but I wouldnâ€™t say anyone on the street could stand up and use it. I am not sure their plans, but they could modify it and use it for so many applications in the business world. This is something I hope they do.

4) Thereâ€™s always sales going on, and I swear I feel like thereâ€™s at least 4 candle day sales per year...

5) With all these sales, specials and coupons, the margins have to be good on their products...but there are a ton of things that eat into it, ie returns at any time even on used products and 6 below. 

6) Anytime they ship, thereâ€™s more than likely a few broken Candles. Which means getting credit back and exchanging etc. 

7) Women flip these like crazy. They have trade groups, sellers / scalpers getting in on limited scents etc and reselling them. 

8) My GF clearly hordes these...despite constantly burning 2-3 of them, thereâ€™s is a ridiculous amount of supply that is never going down. So the supply coming in is offsetting the usage of them.

"A look at 2020's wildest streaks (i.e. back to back moonings!) + answering the question: If a stock has been going up for N days already, what's the probability that it will keep going up?",1609702666,maxfort86,30,"As the self-appointed WSB quant, I took it upon myself to look at 2020 data to find the most extreme consecutive moves up and down for stocks. I'm also going to provide a simple analysis that answers the question ""If stock A has been going up for N days already, what's the probability that  it will keep going up in upcoming day(s)?""

First, I define a stock's daily return in a given day as the percentage change in the price from the previous day's close to that day's close.

Second, I limit the analysis only to [Robinhood's 100 most popular stocks](https://robinhood.com/collections/100-most-popular), because that list includes most of the meme/fun stocks.

Third, I only look at April 2020 onward, because after COVID the market has changed significantly and we are still in this new structure.

# Back-to-Back Positive Moves of Any Size

Let's first look at consecutive positive moves. I don't care if the daily return was +50% or +0.001%, as long as it's above zero and happens back-to-back, we count it.

The largest streak belongs to TWTR, WKHS, and ZNGA, with 11 days! After that is TSLA, SNE, and G-U-S-H with 10 days.

Here are how often each streak happened across all stocks in the sample. For example, streaks of 6 happened 91 times (3.8%) for the stocks in the sample.

[Upstreaks Frequency](https://preview.redd.it/17bnpyao56961.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba0ce56d1c82305ca93d6e6552ffceb8e5129353)

Now, back to the question: if a stock has had a streak of N days already, what's the chance that it will keep going up the next day(s)? For the more statistically literate, P(X &gt; N | X = N). I use the table above and Bayes rule to answer this question:

[Probabilities of a streak continuing given its current length](https://preview.redd.it/1uu3rmot56961.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6a1601ff8260fc1d71e211dd079634da87392b3)

*Of course, these probabilities are for all of the stocks in the sample, and they don't take into account the specific conditions of a stock or the events/rumors/news that might have caused the streak to start.*

&amp;#x200B;

# Back-to-Back Positive Moves of at least 3%

Now let's repeat the above analysis but make it more interesting by focusing only on streaks that involved at least a 3% upside move.

The record here belongs to FCEL, which went up 3%+ for 7 days in a row! During this streak, the price of FCEL went from 2.56 to 8.55!

https://preview.redd.it/f5oe2bp566961.png?width=766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cacf785d1b029a5137e7aeec9ea9bb57a5221b7

Similarly, the probability of seeing a 3%+ move in the upcoming day(s) if you already had such a streak for N days:

*Processing img slrjjqy666961...*

# Back-to-Back Negative Moves of any size

Now let's look at the unlucky stocks that went down for consecutive days. Here the record-breaker is XOM, with 11 days of going south. Must've felt terrible if you held the stock during that period.

https://preview.redd.it/pxe9kjg966961.png?width=876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=faa6f74e63503daa0ec7dca8ebbb23e5eba10790

And lastly

# Back-to-Back Negative Moves of At Least 3%

The record here belongs to I-D-E-X, with 6 days in a row of going to hell! During this time, the price fell from 0.97 to 0.68.

How often such down streaks happened:

Electricity. 

With California and most of the PNW being on the PG&amp;E grid and being a large chunk of the US population $PCG is INCREDIBLY undervalued as a stock. Theyâ€™ve had some hiccups in the last couple years, and theyâ€™ve obviously learned from them because theyâ€™re still around. They canâ€™t get rid of the entire electrical grid of the west coast and they donâ€™t dare break it up during a pandemic because of the cost of such a move. $PCG is going into the new year with no new major fires in 2021, new leadership and new found reliability based purely on my own experience. 

Now to boring shit.
Balance sheets are looking good post settlement and the company is more than able to recover 100% in short order. With that being said they are going to be the largest energy market in the US, so itâ€™s about time we get while we can, the next few days should be WILD.

Engagement Rings: what's the better investment? (Earth or Lab),1609707629,calmsquash515,84,"I know this isn't really wall street but to be fair this sub seemingly has no rules 

I'm contemplating engagement rings and the question is: lab or earth diamond 

Strictly financially speaking the way I see it is you're looking at roughly for a 2ct diamond either $10k for lab or $25k for real. 

Now, the argument that any real diamond jeweler will make to you is: investment. You can resell it, it'll retain value, you can pass it down, etc etc. The lab diamond price will only go down, it will be worth less in 20 years. 

Okay but... What kind of investment is a $25k ring if it'll be worth $25k in 20 years? My thoughts are revolving around the fact that if I took the $15k savings and invested that - conservatively at 6% - I would make $33k gains after 20 years 

I feel like at this point emotion is the only thing that could away a decision here - which I know wsb has a lot of - so what is the investment decision here?"

"Ten(die) Traits of the TENBAGGER ($PLTR, $RKT, $TSLA)",1609707694,LN-beanzo,88," Fellow smooth brains, broke boiz, and gainz girls,

I've had a lot of down time this week since I'm cooped up in q-tine with the vid. Figured I'd change it up and spend time to listen and read about people who actually made money in the markets, instead of edging to EOY loss porn for 10 days straight.

I found a few different hedge fund daddies to keep me company during the alt reality of rona isolation. These dudes weren't smooth brain; they read books and wrote them too. They made all their tendies in the pre-dawn era before the internet, but a lot of their concepts are the foundations of today's DD flair.

One of these hedge fund daddies is Peter Lynch; the silver fox averaged 30% returns over 13 years as manager of Fidelity's Magellan Fund. He frequently &amp; routinely states ""Stonks only go up"" and ""Buy the FKN DIP"" in pre-internet era interviews and he's got a rager for the market advantages of individuals (retail, us, idiots) vs. wall street (chads, citron, warren buffet). He actually walked away from Wall Street at relatively young age to spend more time with his family. This decision can only be interpreted one way; he made enough tendies to send his wife's boyfriend back to instructing $PTON classes and preying on other men's wives. For this, the legacy of he Silver Fox must be immortalized - he is legend.

Anyway, Lynch is pretty famous for coining the characteristics (traits) of a ten bagger. Since I've got lots of time and there's no loss porn on the weekends, I thought it would be an interesting idea to back test some of these ideas on WSB favorites &amp; active bag holders like $RKT, $PLTR, and $TSLA.

**10 Traits of a Ten Bagger:**

**1. Name is Dull or Ridiculous: All tickers check.**

Â· Red $RKT? Sheesh dude calm down.

Â· $PLTR? Fool of a took!

Â· $TSLA? That socialist electrician?

**2. It does something dull: All tickers check.**

Â· $RKT: Mortgage loan processing.

Â· $PLTR: Data aggregation &amp; integration. wut?

Â· $TSLA: Sells cars.

**3. It Does something disagreeable: All tickers check.**

Â· $RKT: Online loan processing is perceived as untrustworthy by institutions &amp; individuals.

Â· $PLTR: Blah blah blah oppression, NSA &amp; data privacy

Â· $TSLA: ""There will never be a market for EVs!""

**4. Institutions don't own &amp; analysts don't follow: Only $PLTR checks.**

Â· $RKT: 15 analysts have coverage with an avg. PT of $24.7

Â· $PLTR: 7 analysts have coverage with an avg. PT of $15

Â· $TSLA: Everyone talkin' TSLA these days. Irrelevant.

**5. It's depressing: All 3 tickers check with some massaging of the interpretation.**

Â· $RKT: When I grew up, home loan refinancing was a bad thing borne from necessity. Exchanging equity for better loan terms prolongs payments and adds long-term interest. These improve affordability and increase in popularity with each recession.

Â· $PLTR: Literally sells system solutions for crisis situations. Think COVID/Conflict/Fraud.

Â· $TSLA: The narrative sells because the climate crisis is the defining issue of our age.

**6. The industry isn't growing: All 3 check with some massaging of the interpretation.**

Â· $RKT: Growth is not the same as appreciation. The housing market continues to spike in part because of archaic housing &amp; city planning policies that prevent new supply from entering markets.

Â· $PLTR: New data points &amp; software solutions continue to be introduced &amp; sold, but PLTR is unique in it's integration &amp; aggregation capabilities. Nobody else is selling this particular solution; in fact, PLTR views their biggest competition as a companies' desire to internalize this solution.

Â· $TSLA: EVs sales are in fact growing exponentially, however the sales are pulling demand from the existing market share of the automobile industry, not creating new market share. Additionally, modern transportation policy ***likely*** reduces the amount of new cars on the road as EVs are increasingly exposed as an edge case for addressing climate change. Also, ARK (momma Wood) has done a bunch of research re: the pending used-car bubble that will put further ownership equity pressure on loans, dealers, and individuals still buying used ICE cars. The combined pressures of costs associated with personal vehicle ownership, rapid asset depreciation, autonomous ride hailing, modern transpo plans focused on decreased congestion &amp; emissions, will significantly reduce the size of this industry in the near/mid term future.

o P.S. I &lt;3 Pete Bootycheeks, US Transpo Sec. Build all the rails &amp; bike lanes.

**7. It's got a NICHE: All 3 check.**

Â· $RKT: mobile loan processing. Speed speed speed. Ease ease ease. Cheese cheese cheese. $RKT's solutions saves time, better prepare buyers &amp; refinancers, simplifies the process, and reduces monthly expense. Rock solid like my $RKT in the mornings.

Â· $PLTR: how many of you work at a fortune 500 (not Wendyâ€™s) that requires you to query data for routine reports? How many logins do you have? how many systems do you need to navigate? Do you know how your co addresses this? They pay managers who can't write =sumif() excel functions, to piece together PowerPoints and workflow diagrams that communicate system enhancements to $100k+ soft devs and system architects who then Frankenstein together 10+ paid SAAS ""solutions"" in 1-3 years. $PLTR comes in hot and ready like the domineos pizza pie delivery guy ready to feed &amp; seed the shmeat lovers. $PLTR works with what you got, growers and showers, to create a highly scalable 2 way data integration &amp; aggregation system in hours.

Â· $TSLA: Battery &amp; self driving tech are the biggest niches at this point, but don't sleep on those EV credits. Wall street industry idiots are salty that $TSLA can improve margins by selling polluter permission slips to allow polluters to pollute, but co's love to pollute so those things print.

**8. Recurring Revenues: All 3 check.**

Â· $RKT: Definition of ""Recurring"": ""occurring again periodically or repeatedly."" $RKT reports a lot of money each quarter's earnings reports. Don't @ me.

Â· $PLTR: the business model is designed to scale billing in tandem with gains made from solution utility.

Â· $TSLA: At this stage, car sales are growing and we haven't hit an extended downturn in the cyclical environment. Just wait till the FSD, energy credits, insurance, ride hailing, and grid energy revenues print infinitely and indefinitely. Anticipate unrealized earnings &amp; receivables to pace with earnings growth.

**-(9. Insiders are buying: $RKT &amp; $TSLA check.**

Â· $RKT: Daddy Dan Gilbert &amp; Juicy Jay Farner were loading up on shares &lt; $20 in August

Â· $PLTR: Mithril (a Papa Thiel fund) got clearance to buy an s-ton of $PLTR at some point last week. Basically, a buy back, but we'll see more when the lock-up period ends.

Â· $TSLA: Denholym sold 43k shares at \~$400 per, but Emperor Elon is diamond handing his market cap option tranches which counts IMO.

**-(10. Its buying back shares: $RKT &amp; $PLTR check.**

Â· $RKT: Announced a completed $1B buyback on the last earnings call

Â· $PLTR: Momma Wood (ARK) has been adding $1m+ in shares each week, but it basically just went public so too early for this.

Â· $TSLA: Issuing new funds to improve cash positions at elevated market cap.

Positions:

Buy the dip, LONG $RKT &amp; $PLTR until $75b market cap, then readjust thesis. $TSLA to $1T market cap, then pivot into 2% divvie stocks till' I transcend into a Silver Fox incarnate.

Why doesn't G B T C ever get mentioned here? Here's why I like it...,1609709261,MrFiveInchTaint,11,"G B T C seems like a decent play to me here. I know it's better to buy B T C direct as there's no mgmt fee or premium, but here's why G B T C makes sense IMO:

* On a macro sense B T C is on a tear and institutional adoption is at an all-time high. Microstrategy in for $500mm, old line insurance company Mass Mutual in for $100mm, Guggenheim recently amended docs to allow up to $500mm of G B T C in its funds and Elon himself tweeted recently about putting some of his companies' money in B T C. My personal target for B T C in 2021 is $50k as 2021 is the year institutions finally feel it's acceptable to hold  B  T C
* B T C is a pain in the ass to buy for Boomers and raises major custody issues for institutions - two of the deepest pockets in the market. G B T C solves both of these issues as institutional ownership of B T C becomes more acceptable and dollar is devalued
* There are currently no pure play B T C ETFs. Van Eck applied for one last week but will face an uphill battle. Likely will need a new SEC commissioner amenable to B T C \*and\* show something different than the companies whose ETF proposals were already rejected. This will take months
* But MrFiveInchTaint, what happens when an ETF is eventually approved - won't G B TC premium disappear? Yeah, probably -- I'm also betting that B TC would run like TSLA before S&amp;P inclusion and offset any premium erosion

Potential catalysts for G B TC this year are continued institutional adoption, a Dem Senate sweep in GA and the $10b of spending that comes with it and even if that doesn't happen, stimulus package 3.0 that's inevitable in the spring.

Georgia Senate Election - POV requested,1609709331,XD1234444,11,"Hi WSB,

I am reaching out to you as a non American to get some answers (serious ones) on what would a democratic senate win most likely mean to the stock market? 

Question 1: On one hand - I heard that if republican wins it's better for companies; on the flip side if Dems win more stimulus very soon. Is that in general true? Do you agree with what I am hearing / reading?

Question 2: will there be any particular sectors benefitting from a Democrat win? e.g. Cannabis, Solar/Alternative energy? How true is that? Alternatively, will there be any sector that will be impacted negatively?

Question 3: I have these current holdings: RKT, NIO, APHA, TLRY, NOV, BABA, WBA, NOK, BBBY, DBX, KMI. Do you see any particular red flag with any of these in case Democrats win?

Thank you so much in advance for helping out!"

Why I YOLOâ€™d 10k into weekly weed stocks options (DD),1609709367,AliensStoleMyLizard,6,"Sup retards. I hear you autistic fucks like yer trendies huh? Well, I got a new one for you that a lot of you probably wonâ€™t like, but fuck it, donâ€™t say I didnâ€™t tell you so. With some thorough research, and a little bit of personal opinion, I am 100% confident that weed stocks are the move for this week and the rest of 2021 ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ 

Better buckle up for 2021.... and hereâ€™s why:

If any of you stupid fucks have been watching the Georgia senate polls, youâ€™ll notice that the democrats have been slowly catching up to the republicans, and are now LEADING according to todayâ€™s polls. Now, I know what youâ€™re thinking, â€œtHe PoLlS aRe NeVeR rIgHt!!â€ Well yes, I agree, polls are fucking stupid to go off of based on the massive amounts of incorrect polls weâ€™ve received in the past. HOWEVER, according to the results from the recent early voting, the demographic heavily favors the Democratic Party. In the original 2020 senate election, there were about 4m votes, and thereâ€™s 3m in the early voting. Thatâ€™s insane considering there has never been this amount of votes for early voting in a senate runoff EVER. In large democratic counties, such as DeKalb and Fulton County, that favor democrats, early voter turnout is incredibly high. The median amount of registered voters who early voted for larger counties was approximately 62%, while the smaller conservative counties clocked in at 58%. And as we know, African Americans voted for 89% for democrats but white Americans only accounted for about 68% of republicans votes. This is great news for democrats as this means there is a high turnout for them in these large counties. It also seems like Republican voters are more willing to sit out of this election as President Donald trump has called out rigging of elections, as well as Kelly Loeffler showing constant support for Trump could hurt her chances of re-election. As of today, Jon Ossoff leads Perdue by 1.8%, while Raphael Warnock leads by 2.2%.

Not only do the polls suggest democrats are ahead, but retarded gamblers such as ourselves are starting to bet on a democratic majority.

You bitches are about to bust so many god damn nuts. According to PredictIt.com, betters are majority in favor of BOTH democratic candidates. Yesterday, Warnock was leading Loeffler .57c to .45c. NOW, Warnock has a huge lead with .60c to Loefllers .43c. Ossoff is LEADING NOW too with .52c to Perdues .51c. As everyone knows, NO ONE LIKES TO LOSE MONEY. So, why are all these gamblers investing in the democrats if they werenâ€™t favored to win? Because they ARE favored to win now. If those retarded gamblers are willing to gamble their money away on a Democratic senate win, then gambling your money on weed stocks is the perfect alternative to making fat stacks. As you can probably conclude, the betting is so low for a split ticket between a democrat and republican, itâ€™s expected to be almost impossible for both parties to be elected. There will only be one.

Not only this, but the majority of Georgians SUPPORT $2000 stimulus checks. This is especially bad for the Republican senators who rejected the vote on $2000 stimulus checks, but GREAT for the democratic runners. Georgians are expected to come out in waves to support the candidates that want the $2000 checks. This will lead to wider democratic support as the senate elections near and explain why the democrats are starting to get a lead. 

DEMOCRATS WILL WIN GEORGIA, AND TAKE THE SENATE, MARK MY WORDS!!

So why should you not lose all your money in GME and PLTR calls? Because this shit will make you more $$$ in one week than holding calls for months with those shitty ass short stocks. Thatâ€™s why I ended up YOLOING my entire balance on MSOS calls. MSOS is an ETF of American weed stocks, and is the perfect tendie gain for the upcoming news of a democratic victory. I was going to go with TLRY, but an ETF of American weed stocks looked like the better play both short and long term. 

Positions: $10k in MSOS ETF calls 40c 1/15/21 (ALL IN)

ALL IN BAYBEEE LETS BEAT MUSK TO MARS ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€


TL;DR: Weed stocks are going to fly in 2021. Democrats WILL win Georgia and take over the senate. Tons of fucking tendies in 2021 for all weed stocks, especially American.ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€"

Trading Reality Check,1609710012,Blackout1154,8,"This comes to you from TheStreet:

 

## 1. Predictions and Forecasts Are a Waste of Time

In the many years I've traded, I've heard an uncountable number of predictions and forecasts. The vast majority have been wrong or so poorly timed as to be useless. Wall Street loves predictions and forecasts because that is basically what they sell. They convince customers that they can predict the future better than you can and therefore you should pay them for their guesses about the future.

The market situation in 2020Â was one of the best examples ever of the futility of forecasting. No one anticipated what happened: a major pandemic, the worst economy in a century, a crazy political situation, and the stock market flying higher despite the news.

Predictions and forecasts are interesting and can help us prepare for volatility ahead, but it is the reaction to changing events that is the most important. Moving to the sidelines as a downtrend emerges will protect you better than any prediction or forecast. It is reacting decisively that works far better than predictions and forecasts.

Don't focus on anticipation and predictions. Focus on vigilance and reaction.

## 2. Compound Your Profits by Keeping Your Accounts as Close to Highs as Possible

Nothing is more counterproductive than making up losses. If you lose half of your money, you must double it to just return to even. If you are zealous at keeping your accounts near highs, you will outperform over the longer term.

Long-term buy-and-hold investing is often promoted because it allows you to compound your money and that it is what makes investors such as Warren Buffett so successful. However, you can also compound results when you keep your accounts at highs and continue to produce returns. It is not necessary to hold a single stock and hope that it is ""the one"" that will make you rich. You can engage in aggressive trading as you look for the best stocks and still benefit from the power of compounding by keeping your accounts near their highs.

Compounding fails to work when you suffer big drawdowns and losses. This happens to both long-term investors and short-term traders that fail to protect their gains. The key is to address it and not just sit there. If you err on the side of not suffering large losses, you will produce substantially better returns as you compound your capital.

&gt;*Charts are often dismissed as voodoo by the same people confident in their ability to predict macroeconomic events.*

## 3. Profits Occur Sporadically

The market is, and always will be, cyclical. It goes through ups and downs of various magnitudes on an irregular basis. Newer traders likely have a very unrealistic view of the bigger market picture. The style of trading that is working right now will not last forever and if you do not appreciate that fact, then your career in trading will be short-lived.

Traders should be mindful of the 80/20 rule. Most traders will typically produce 80% of their profits in 20% of the time. The other 80% of the time they make little progress. New traders that have immediate success will have a tough time dealing with this fact as the market shifts. Many have been spoiled recently by a fantastic market and they will give back much of their profits and eventually give up in defeat because they are not prepared for the inevitable shifts the market will undergo.

The problem with the 80/20 rule is that we never know when that period of peak productivity will occur. We must be constantly vigilant and ready to spring into action when favorable conditions occur. When they do occur, we have to ramp up our aggressiveness and profit while we can.

One trait effective traders share is the ability to be patient and do little for long periods, and then move suddenly and decisively when the time is right. Shifting from a patient state of mind to a more active one is not easy and becoming more cautious when conditions change is the key to holding onto gains.

## 4. Use Charts

Charts are often dismissed as voodoo by the same people who are confident of their ability to predict macroeconomic events, but they miss the main point. Charts are useful because they provide a framework for discipline. There are millions of ways to use charts, but at the heart of every method is cutting losses and letting profits run.

Don't think of charts as a way to predict the future. Think of charts as a way to manage your existing trades. The charts will help you when to buy and when to sell, but they won't tell you what is going to happen in the future. Charts are the best tool you have for developing the discipline you need to be a successful trader over the long haul.

## 5. No Trading Approach Is Inherently Superior

The best approach to the market is highly subjective. Some people do very well with trend-following and momentum. Others do equally well with value plays and fundamentals. What works best will depend on how you view the market and the methodology you use to protect capital and find new stocks to buy.

Work on developing a style that makes sense to you. If it doesn't work as well as you'd like, keep modifying it. The market is constantly changing, which means what works best will shift all the time. Just make sure you keep in mind the discussion about how profits tend to occur sporadically.

## 6. Trade Incrementally and in Multiple Time Frames

Most people think of the trading and investing process as being a single buy and then an eventual sale. They decide that this is a good stock, buy it, and then sit there and hope that it works out well. There is no strategy involved in this sort of market approach. You lose your power to control the situation when you trade in this manner.

The better approach is to move incrementally. Take an initial position and watch the action. Perhaps your opinion of the stock was wrong, or the market shifts. You can then quickly escape the situation with little loss. However, if the stock continues to develop well, then you can build the trade and become more aggressive.

As a good trade develops, you can focus on navigating it in a variety of time frames. Maybe keep a core position for weeks, months, or years while trading a portion as the inevitable ups and downs occur. Some of the best long-term buys also provide for great day trading. If you have a good stock pick, then why not trade it in multiples.

This strategic approach to trading and investing is key, and I spend a great amount of time expanding on this topic.

## 7. Trading Is Hard,Â Which Is Why It Can Make You Rich

If you read social media, it is easy to develop the impression that thousands of people make a huge amount of money with a steady diet of great stock picks.

The reality is that trading is tough and that even the best traders have substantial losses along the way. The very best traders are those that embrace the inevitable of poor trades and make them part of their process. No matter how good you are at trading, you will have losing streaks and be hit by tremendous bad luck at times. It is the nature of the beast.

However, it is because trading is so hard that it has the potential to reward you so greatly. It is trite to say, but it is true, ""nothing good comes easy."" It may feel easy at times, but long-term market success is a daily slog that requires hard work and will often be disappointing. Rather than be discouraged, take heart because if it was easy, you couldn't get rich doing it."

Why Index Funds are Not as Safe and Bubbles are Not as Destructive as You Might Believe,1609711738,negovany,262,"  According to Morningstar research in the middle of 2019 almost half of all US stocks were part of some passive index fund. This number almost doubled since 2009. In the meantime, active management is on a steady decline, especially active managed funds. Around the same time Dr. Michael Burry compared index funds to CDOs. Letâ€™s look into this case and try to draw something from it for our benefit.  

**1. How come index funds are compared to CDOs if they only track industries or sectors of economy?**

 What we often miss is that the index fund, instead of being a neutral observer, is an active participant in the fundamentals of the companies that compose a particular index. The fund does so by providing capital and influencing market value of a security (this also opens a window of opportunities for the company behind the ticker to raise capital via bank loans or private investments). Whatâ€™s so bad about this? Well, passive funds donâ€™t go through balance sheets, there is no fair value assessment, no analysis and no risk taking. They just buy whatever company is big enough to make it into the index. This company can then use provided capital to stay afloat or influence itâ€™s price by share buybacks, dividends or simply pay huge bonuses to itâ€™s management. Just like banks didnâ€™t care about subprime mortgages that were packed into CDOs, index funds managers donâ€™t care about what exactly goes into their â€˜soupâ€™. With the banks it was just greed and ignorance â€“ in case of index funds itâ€™s by design.  

When there is a stable influx of new capital into passive funds, zombie companies are dragged higher and higher. WSB goddess **Cathie Wood** called this the greatest misallocation of funds in the history. But why is so much cash flowing into index funds? Is it a trend? Is someone incentivized to promote them? Well, yes, but the main reason is different: boomer psychology and our friend, the FED. See, boomers have massive capitals. All those pension funds, retiring firefighters, trust babies, capital heirs â€“ they all seek safety. They donâ€™t try to get 500% returns YOY or lose it all. They are very content with just beating inflation. Throw few percents above inflation and they will be over the moon. For a long time their favorite asset class were treasuries.  

**2. What is happening to the bond market?**

 In 2016 US bond market was almost $40 trillion in value, compared to less than $20 trillion for the domestic stock market.  Now, I havenâ€™t seen yet the data about the size of US bond market of 2020, but everything points that itâ€™s ratio to stock market is deteriorating. The US 10-year government-bond yield fell from nearly 2.00% at the beginning of the year to an all-time low of just 0.31% in early March. Thatâ€™s what Rick Rule called â€˜return free riskâ€™, since allocating capital into these treasuries almost guarantees you to lose money to inflation. 

*Processing img q6r2fhqfu6961...*

Look at what is happening in Europe: â€œThe ECB, which added 500 billion euros ($606 billion) to its pandemic bond buying program, is set to own around 43% of Germanyâ€™s sovereign bond market by the end of next year and around two-fifths of Italian notes, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Thatâ€™s up from around 30% and 25% respectively at the end of 2019... Trading volumes in bund futures have collapsed 62% since the ECB started buying bonds, according to Axa, while ranges the lifeblood of traders have nosedived across Europe. In both the safest and riskiest nations, this quarterâ€™s spread between the highest and lowest yields is the tightest itâ€™s been since at least the global financial crisis.â€

The FED is doing quite the same. Buying bonds (including corporate) all over the place and lowering interest rates to the ground. Whatâ€™s even more devastating for boomers is that thereâ€™s no hope on the horizon: the Fed promises to keep interest rates low for the next few years. We are really heading towards Japan situation where the central bank is that fat ugly bully kid playing all by himself in the sandbox.

**3. Where to go if the bonds are not so hot?** 

 This all causes big money to chase the next best thing. What do people consider safe? Real Estate. And indeed it rose: according to Knight Frank Global House price index US housing prices rose 7% from Q3 2019 to Q3 2020. But thatâ€™s a lot of hustle for big money. And that is hardly a passive income, rather a career. So the next best thing is index funds. What can be better than tracking the whole US economy? Never bet against America, am I right? Even if we stumble upon a market crash sending S&amp;P down â€“ the economy will recover, it always does, right? The influx of cash into ETFs is basically a self fulfilling prophecy: it drives prices up and those yearly returns get even more lucrative compared to *sexy* 0.31% provided by treasuries.  

*Processing img db73yu15u6961...*

Even worse is that actively managed funds and bank investments start to, basically, replicate index funds. That is due to the risk/reward factor: if the funds outperform the market - they get some good rep and few new customers; but when they underperform the market â€“ they get absolutely obliterated. Only few outsiders can risk picking deep value stocks or plays, that are not common portfolio dwellers. Or it takes someone with huge authority like Warren Buffett or Howard Marks. 

**4. Bubbles everywhere**

 Now, at this point you might be on the edge of your seat, banging your fist and thinking that this is nothing but a bubble and the boomers, index funds and the Fed are to blame. Well, it is. Hard truth is that fundamentals in the long run always kick-in. So-called Buffett indicator (total stocks market cap to GDP) is almost at a record high. And on top of that we have Dot.com bubble 2.0 with crazy tech enthusiasm. And a second real estate bubble too. But I urge you to notice, that bubbles are not all the same with the same outcome. Well, they all go burst, but thatâ€™s not the point. There are bubbles that I would call â€˜General Market Heatâ€™ - situations when too much money goes into the market, causing it to overheat. Then some sort of event, panic, fear, or rumor, not necessary caused by declining fundamentals, sends the market to downward spiral. As an example: panic of 1857, 1929, 1987, etc. The better the fundamentals were and the least the government gets involved â€“ the faster it rebounds. Those bubbles do nothing but attract more speculators and their only result is the number of bankruptcies. Then there are bubbles that I would call â€˜Thematic Bubblesâ€™ - those are dedicated to some specific industry or a number of particular stocks that are expected to grow enormously. Tulip Mania in Netherlands (1637), Railway Mania in UK (1840s), Video Games Crash of 1983, Dot Com Bubble (2000). They all chased some particular novelty and all landed on their faces. But doing so they provided huge capital to developing industries. Dot Com Bubble gave us rapid growth of internet usage. Video Games chase of the late 70s and early 80s gave us the golden age of arcade gaming and huge inventions in graphics and game tech. Railway Mania left Britain with the largest system of railroads in the world. And guess who is the biggest exporter of tulips and holds 49 % of the global flower market? Yep, Netherlands, to this day, almost 400 years since the mania!  

This did not in any way benefit the majority of investors who went down with the bubble. But you can view this as a sacrifice of dumb and greedy people for the benefit of the progress. I get a sense of pride in this noble cause, as a member of WSB community.  

Back to boomers and index funds. By pouring money into index funds they provide capital both to disruptive industries and to zombie companies. The good thing is that the tech gets the majority of it, since it has the biggest share. Just look at the SPY top 6 holdings:  

*Processing img ien160wku6961...*

Itâ€™s genuinely good that companies like Tesla will get allocation of billions and billions which they (frankly) do not quite deserve at current fundamentals. This will accelerate their growth. The bad thing is that such allocations cement big tech monopolies, damaging competition. And it also provides liquidity to zombie companies big enough to make it into indexes.  

Difference is that innovative companies use this cash to reinvest into future growth. Thatâ€™s exactly why their P/E ratios are so bad. Zombies spend cash on buybacks and management bonuses. Because of how all these companies are tied together in index funds and due to the nature of modern margin calls â€“ once any segment of the stock market falls, there will be a massive dip. Tech can drown any industry stocks with them and vice versa. But the Tech will be able to cut investments, R&amp;D and expansions and become profitable, while zombies with a big debt will go bankrupt. Either way itâ€™s investors, who will bear the pain.  

**5. What shall we draw from here:**

1) There are huge inflows into the stock market. And the blame is not so much on the kids with RH as it is on the boomers and â€˜smart moneyâ€™ chasing index funds;  

2) If you want to short any of the bubbles as a hedge â€“ do not short the most growing and volatile sectors and ETFs like QQQ, because they benefit from the current market in a long run. And also the premiums are huge due to IV. Rather short slow and steady industries, because they will get nuked just as much in case of a crash, but the premiums you pay now will be much lower;

3) Passive index funds investing makes â€˜price discoveryâ€™ and a search for deep value so much more challenging. But not impossible. Basically, Peter Lynchâ€™s advise to look for companies with smaller institutional ownership still lives up today.

Does this mean that prices canâ€™t be good or go up under big index allocation? Hell no. But the chance to find a ten-bagger declines.  

As an anecdote: look into our championâ€™s GME institutional ownership: on Jan 31 2020 it was 96.6 % and declined to relatively low 66.7 by Sep 30. Exactly before it doubled in the next 3 months;

4) Some bubbles provide needed capital to developing and hyped industries causing structural change. Unfortunately, it is paid by investors who rarely see any return;

5) FED is to blame for everything (as always);

6) WSBers will lose money either way (as always).

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

**The bond market is similar to boomers wives: sexy in the 80s, not so much today. Constant intrusions by their relatives (the FED) into their relationships makes things even worse. That sends boomers chasing young girls - the stocks. But their dongles arenâ€™t so active anymore, so boomers prefer passive approach, using a dating app - index funds. Unfortunately, there are only so many hot girls among young ladies on the app. This leads to ugly ones receiving attention and money from boomers, which they otherwise wouldnâ€™t deserve. Some of those ladies spend money wisely and will be good to go once the boomer dies out. Others immediately waste it on shopping. Now, if a young man wants to find a truly beautiful lady with reasonable expectations â€“ he has a better chance searching outside of the boomer dating app.**

MOVIE THEATERS ON MARS?! (DD) ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€,1609712319,jcaliente12,63,"What up you gay nerds. Here's 4 reasons why movie theaters will NOT go bankrupt and why they will rebound by March 2021. (DD)

1) Stock offerings. These are bound to happen. Movie theaters have been among the companies hit the hardest during this global pandemic and raising money through stock offerings are not unique to movie theaters. However, I can tell you, as a veteran of the stock market, stock offerings of this volume are NOT an action taken by companies about to go bankrupt. It is merely to stay afloat. They know that positive news is coming, and those who benefit are those who don't bearishly think bankruptcy is an option for a powerhouse movie theater brands. Don't shell out your hard-earned $5 on RH gold to read bullshit from bear-cuck analysts like Morningstar and buy shares instead. Thank me later.  
 

2) Adaptation. We are adapting to this pandemic. We now understand COVID-19 to be a droplet-transmissible disease that can be prevented by wearing a mask and taking basic precautions like washing your hands before eating/touching your mucous membranes. As a hospital administrator, I work with both friends and family who work intimately with COVID positive patients for HOURS in the ICU and ED and none of them have contracted it... why? Because PPE WORKS! (goddamnit anti-maskers). When Biden steps into office, you will immediately see a rise in movie theater stocks, as they are often the first to rebound because we all understand it's upward potential. In the next month, as the highest at risk (elderly/those with predisposed symptoms) receive their second dose of vaccinations, we will see a declining number of severe cases, leading to a sharp decrease in ICU hospitalizations. This news will be good for movie theaters. As the general public receives the vaccine, we will see public confidence returning and many will return to the theaters (with masks of course).  
 

3) Demand. We've all been stuck inside for almost a year, watching the same Netflix shows as our parents. Fun fact: Movie theaters BOOMED in the 30s post-Spanish flu, because humans have an inherent need to watch flicks on the big screen. Think of all you retard autists and how you're going to try and spit game after a year of staying in. Fuck that. Take your date to the theaters and talk about something relatable besides that you gained 20 pounds ordering from Uber Eats every day for the past year.  
 

4) AM\*+ (Yes, A\*C+ is the rebrand of \_\_\_ premier, the streaming service for \*MC and it is a critical reason for why they will stay in business and thrive.) The Walking Dead Season 10 is out by the way (surprisingly good, considering they killed off most of the OG cast). Subscription goes for $8.99 a month and counts estimate over 1 million new subscribers in 2020. Do the math and expect this to bolster stock price at the next earning report.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Those who buy in now to movie theater stocks should see 100-200% gains by Spring 2021. Quote me on it. Ban me if it doesn't happen."

NIO $50 Call 01/15 bought at 2x its current value. Thoughts?,1609713048,archer_it,66,"Hello fellow retards,

In mid-November, I made a very stupid purchase and bought $50c with Jan 15 exp at $8.35. 

My call went down as much as 64% as of Dec 28, but I held. In the past week, itâ€™s gained close to 30%. Overall, the call is now worth $4.15, ~50% below my purchase price.

Given the recent great news regarding December and 4Q20 deliveries as well as NIO day on Jan 9, what do you think I should do with my call? 
- Hold until then to limit my losses given the uptrend? or 
- Do you think itâ€™s worth roll it over to March-May call?

Thanks retards!

Best,

PLTR Valuation Lies,1609715462,IHateMonie,88,"Don't listen to the analyst's lies or the articles about valuation. The concept of valuation is being used as a weapon against you and right now the only reason PLTR ðŸš€ stock is dropping is because of:

1) Heavy short interest with 70M (as of early December) shares sold short out of \~500m float.

2) Tards losing money on the massive amount of weekly call buying. 

&amp;#x200B;

PLTRðŸš€ is a good company and the institutions know it. Back in 2018 Morgan Stanley was saying that their IPO in 2020 should be 36-41B ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-18/palantir-weighs-ipo-valued-at-as-much-as-41-billion-wsj-says](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-18/palantir-weighs-ipo-valued-at-as-much-as-41-billion-wsj-says)). This price was based off of projections using growth numbers from back in 2018. We know that growth has picked up a bit. As of last Thursday PLTR ðŸš€ is currently valued at 41B but the last PT and ""downgrade"" Morgan Stanley gave was  a $17 or a 30B market cap. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Back in 2018 Morgan Stanley said PLTRðŸš€ was worth \~$23.60 (41B market cap) a share and now they are saying it is worth $17 (30B market cap) a share. They are trying to steal tendies from you."
