not really, for many reasons. The worst age group was 65+ while ""near the end of their life"" could mean like 85+, that's a 20 year difference. Also the vaccine has a much higher survival rate than the virus, it isn't even close. Also also, the virus kills healthy old people who aren't frail and would easily survive the vaccine. 

On top of that, the vaccine provides (Eventually) herd immunity to those too old and too frail to get the vaccine, so they dont have to worry about getting covid because everyone else around them in vaccinated.

ALSO ALSO also, it isn't just survival rates, covid survivors have been experiencing (as of right now) semi-permanent/long term symptoms such as fatigue and lung scarring that don't occur with the vaccine.",Targetshopper4000

People talk about squeezing Melvin capital, but you can‚Äôt, they have puts. You can however gamma squeeze the dealer that sold them the options, but that already happened and can‚Äôt happen again except the reverse if the price falls (if they still have puts)

Short squeeze could continue but here‚Äôs the thing...most direct shorts are large institutions. They have risk management. You can‚Äôt margin call them easily as they‚Äôll have 20-50 positions in an account and GME is just one of them. A lot of them who were in earlier probably covered, and there are likely a lot of new shorts some who are in the green. It‚Äôs true they pay large short fees that they can‚Äôt pay forever. But Wsb also can get squeezed as longs because a lot of people lack patience and others use otm call options that will decay at a loss if the price doesn‚Äôt rise. 

Anyway I think the flaws in reasoning are that the shorts can be squeezed to low short interest at which point wsb wins. In reality, the big win was this week and an additional win requires a lot more buying. And the shorts may just not cover, and even if they do, you‚Äôll find more shorts.",Unlucky-Prize

1. They can also assume that the paper hands won‚Äôt be willing to hold for so long and will eventually sell bringing the price back down. They can also continue shorting as well. Why would the lose so much money when it‚Äôs going to go back down? 
2. A shorted position needs to be able to buy the stock at current price to cover. It doesn‚Äôt HAVE to, but it needs to be ABLE to. Otherwise they‚Äôll get margin called and the broker will sell it at the market. There can be a chain reaction if a small player gets fucked

If there is any valid reason to have a sell limit, please someone fill  me in. I've read something about not having a sell limit means your  shares can be loaned out. Does this mean its harder to sell when you  want? Idk. But this is the type of shit we should be talking about for  Christ sake.

&amp;#x200B;

 

If you're ever feeling weak, there's a mental exercise that's guaranteed to turn those üßªüôå into üíéüôå !

For this exercise, I need you to close your eyes.

Are they closed?

Good.

I want you to imagine your wife's boyfriend. Think about how cool he looks on his motorcycle. Imagine how your wife excitedly jumps on the back of his motorcycle and wraps her arms around him.

Now, notice how tightly she holds onto him when he pulls the throttle as they speed off to a nice dinner with your credit card.

You need to understand that she WANTS to hold him. She takes pleasure in holding him. She's not holding him because she's afraid to fall off, even though she will fall off if she lets go. She's holding him because it feels good.

That's energy you need to channel while you BUY and HOLD $GME! You're not holding because you're scared. You're holding because it feels good. You're holding, because holding $GME is what gets you off. When the ride is over, you're going to be sad to let go. You're going to miss the warmth of all that strong $GME in your arms.

After you realize this, you may never sell.

Please note: This is not financial advice. I'm dumb as shit. I lost all of my money betting on MoviePass.

6 Shares $GME @ $285. Holding until I have enough money to bring MoviePass back to life. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ",PlasmaReuse

Because you can buy shit ton more OTM calls with the same money than ITM calls. Gamma also rises as the strike approaches ATM ( gamma is highest atm ) so delta rises faster for otm as they approach atm compare to atm going deep itm. But mainly because of the leverage otm option provide relative to itm.

Gonna make up number 

For example stock ABC trades at $50

Strike $100 is 20 cents and delta of 15 and strike $50 with delta of 50 cost is $1.5

If a large institution puts 1 million is strike 100, that's 50k option ( leverage 5 million shares ) delta is 5m x 0.15 = 750,000

MM buys 750k shares to hedge. Now if delta goes to 0.45 , the MM hedge by buying 5m x .30 delta = 1.5 million 


Now if they buy 1m strike 50 at $3 thats 6666 contracts at delta of .5 = 6.6k x 100 x 0.5 =  320k share.

If share rises the same amount since the gamma is slower than otm the delta goes to to 70, so mm hedge by buying additional 6.6k x 100 x .2 = 133k


Is in example one , 1 million in a stock with uptrend forces MM to buy 750k shares plus 1.5m = 2.25 million 

The second one they only bought 133k plus 320k = 450k

So it's a combination of the extra leverage and gamma rising faster as it approaches the option strike ( delta increases more for otm than itm or atm)",Lord_Python_Of_WSB

Because you can buy shit ton more OTM calls with the same money than ITM calls. Gamma also rises as the strike approaches ATM ( gamma is highest atm ) so delta rises faster for otm as they approach atm compare to atm going deep itm. But mainly because of the leverage otm option provide relative to itm.

Gonna make up number 

For example stock ABC trades at $50

Strike $100 is 20 cents and delta of 15 and strike $50 with delta of 50 cost is $1.5

If a large institution puts 1 million is strike 100, that's 50k option ( leverage 5 million shares ) delta is 5m x 0.15 = 750,000

MM buys 750k shares to hedge. Now if delta goes to 0.45 , the MM hedge by buying 5m x .30 delta = 1.5 million 


Now if they buy 1m strike 50 at $3 thats 6666 contracts at delta of .5 = 6.6k x 100 x 0.5 =  320k share.

If share rises the same amount since the gamma is slower than otm the delta goes to to 70, so mm hedge by buying additional 6.6k x 100 x .2 = 133k


Is in example one , 1 million in a stock with uptrend forces MM to buy 750k shares plus 1.5m = 2.25 million 

The second one they only bought 133k plus 320k = 450k

So it's a combination of the extra leverage and gamma rising faster as it approaches the option strike ( delta increases more for otm than itm or atm)",Lord_Python_Of_WSB
